<P>Welcome to my humble DHTML site. Have you ever experienced DHTML? is a site 
made by me, Thomas Brattli, mostly for fun, but also to show you the 
capabilities of cross-browser Dynamic HTML. And to give you the opportunity to 
use some nice DHTML effects on your own site (check the scriptomania). This page 
alone is filled with fun features, it's hand coded with over 1000 lines of code. 
I have obviously included lot's more the I really had to on this page, but as I 
said, it's to show you some of the things DHTML can do. </P>
<P>This page will be slow on older computers, and if it's to slow use the page 
control and check out the quickmenu. </P>
<P>Everything here is made by and Copyrighted (C) 1999 Thomas Brattli. The 
scripts from the scripts section are free to use just keep the copyright notice 
in there everything else is off limit. </P></BODY></HTML>
