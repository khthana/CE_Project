<Spacer Size = 155>The Stock Maintenance System of the Computer Department is now manually managed and must suffer<BR>
with the problem of inconvinience and slowliness. A way to solve this problem is using a computer system to manage it instead. <BR>
The first step of this project is an analysis and design of the system ’s relational database by NIAM Conceptual model. Then, <BR>
implement programs and user interfaces that relate with every useful activities , and also the reports for others necessary <BR>
information. So, this can improve the efficiency of the old system not only in case of working speed but also the accuracy of work. <BR>
The system will be more convinient and easier to work.
