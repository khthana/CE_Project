<h1>Chapter 2 <br> Before You Start</h1>
</center>
"Before You Start" chapters are easy to skip. It's tempting to jump 
right to installing the software. However, we politely request that you 
read this chapter before installing WebSite.
<p>
To make completing pre-install requirements less painful, the chapter 
starts with a checklist of the important items you need. Once you 
complete the checklist, go to <a href="ws11_03.htm"> Chapter 3, 
<i>Installing WebSite,</i> </a> and install WebSite.
<p>
If you aren't sure about something on the checklist, take some time and 
read the rest of this chapter. You'll find the basic information you need 
regarding hardware, software, and connectivity requirements. We also 
discuss the pros and cons of running WebSite as a desktop application 
or as a service. Additional resources are listed if you want more 
detailed information about any of the topics covered.
<p>
So sharpen your pencil and complete the checklist, then get ready to 
unleash the power of WebSite.
<p>

<h2> Hardware Requirements</h2>
One of the major advantages of WebSite is that it runs on readily 
available, relatively low-cost hardware. The minimum hardware requirement 
allows WebSite to run at a level of performance equal to a Web server 
running on a similarly configured UNIX system. WebSite is a 
powerful, rugged server, limited only by the hardware on which you 
choose to run it and connect it to the Internet.
<p>
If you expect high volume traffic or plan to run many heavy-duty 
applications such as database services, you should expand your 
hardware. Perhaps the single most significant hardware component 
that affects performance is RAM. WebSite performance increases 
substantially with increased amounts of RAM. 
<p>
WebSite also fully supports symmetric multiprocessing (that is, 
multiple processors in a single computer) to handle processing-intense 
web applications. You may also want to investigate a high-speed 
connection to the Internet, such as ISDN or a leased T1 or T3 line.
<h2> Software Requirements</h2>
WebSite runs under two operating systems: Windows NT 3.51 (or 
higher) or Windows 95. Under Windows NT, WebSite can run on 
either a FAT file system or NTFS. WebSite also runs successfully 
under all beta versions of Windows NT 4.0 and the new shell that is 
part of that version.
<p>
Note that previous versions of WebSite ran under Windows NT 3.5; 
WebSite requires version 3.51 of Windows NT. In addition, we 
recommend you install Service Pack 4 for Windows NT. This service 
pack fixed several bugs that can adversely affect WebSite's 
performance. You can obtain the service pack from the Microsoft Web 
site.
<p>
You must also have a Web browser to take advantage of WebSite's 
online resources and capabilities. 
<p>
You can upgrade to WebSite from any previous version of WebSite 
(1.0, 1.1, or any of the interim service releases). You do not need to 
uninstall an existing copy of WebSite to upgrade. All configuration 
information and any data files you created with a previous version of 
WebSite are preserved during the upgrade process.
<h2> Connectivity Requirements</h2>
Networking and connectivity issues are often at the root of problems 
you may encounter when starting WebSite. For that reason, please 
read this section thoroughly. 
<h3> TCP/IP</h3>
WebSite requires that your system have a TCP/IP stack installed and 
running. TCP/IP is the suite of networking protocols that the World 
Wide Web--in fact, the whole Internet--requires. TCP/IP stands for 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. You don't need to 
understand all the nuances of TCP/IP, but you do have to have it 
running successfully on your computer to use WebSite. TCP/IP 
capability is built in to both Windows NT and Windows 95 and no 
additional software is needed.
<p>
If you are on a networked system or have an existing Internet 
connection, you probably don't have to worry about your TCP/IP setup. 
Check with your network administrator or Internet service provider to 
make sure you have the items required by WebSite.
<p>
If you don't have TCP/IP running, you must set it up before installing 
WebSite. You can do so through the Network option of the Control 
Panel. For more information on installing and configuring TCP/IP on 
your computer, see the operating system's documentation.
<p>
In any of the following cases, your system must be running TCP/IP. 
You can use your WebSite server in one of three ways: (1) as an 
internal web server to be reached only by other computers on your 
internal network---an intranet, (2) as a web server connected to the 
Internet and reachable by other computers on the Internet, or (3) as a 
development system for Web applications with no physical connection 
to the Internet or a network.
<h4> IP address</h4>
An important piece of information you need to know about your 
TCP/IP setup is the IP address assigned to your server. The IP address 
is a set of four numbers, one to three digits each, separated by periods 
(or dots), for example, 204.148.40.6. You will need the IP address for 
testing the server.
<h4> TCP/IP connection to an internal network</h4>
Using WebSite on an intranet to provide an internal web (such as for a 
department or departments of a company) requires that the network be 
running TCP/IP, and that the computer on which you install WebSite 
has a properly configured connection to that network. If you are on a 
network, get the IP address for the WebSite server from your network 
administrator.
<h4> TCP/IP connection to the Internet</h4>
If you want your web to be reachable by other computers on the 
Internet, you need an Internet connection that puts your computer ``on 
the Internet.'' There are three primary ways a computer can be 
connected to the Internet, as shown in Figure 2-1.

<DT>
<b>Dial-up shell account</b>
<DD>
Although inexpensive and readily available, a dial-up shell account 
will not work for WebSite because it does not support the TCP/IP 
protocol suite.
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
<br>
Commercial online service providers such as Prodigy, CompuServe, 
and America Online currently offer some type of Internet access and 
expect to offer fuller access in the near future. However, these services 
will not give you the kind of connection necessary to run the WebSite 
server.
</blockquote>
<DT>
<b>PPP or SLIP Account</b>
<DD>
Also, a dial-up account, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) and SLIP 
(Serial Line Internet Protocol) can work for WebSite because they 
support TCP/IP and graphical Web browsers such as Mosaic. A 
PPP/SLIP account requires a high-speed modem (9600 bits per second 
minimum; 14.4 or 28.8 kbps are better) to connect your computer to an 
Internet service provider. Once the connection is established, your 
computer is actually part of the Internet. If both types of accounts are 
available, we recommend a PPP account.
<p>
Your PPP/SLIP provider will assign an IP address for your computer. 
The service provider will also assign (or let you choose) a name for 
your computer, provide DNS name server addresses, and register your 
computer's name with DNS (see below for more).
<p>
If you choose to use a PPP or SLIP connection, you will need software 
to dial the Internet service provider and establish the proper 
connection. The Remote Access Service (RAS) under Windows NT or 
Dial-Up Networking under Windows 95 can handle these tasks. 
<p>
Most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) charge monthly fees and hourly 
usage fees. They may also have special packages for businesses 
requiring 24-hour connections. You should discuss various packages 
with your Internet service provider before choosing a connection.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Dedicated Line</b>
<DD>
The most expensive and difficult to set up, a dedicated line (such as a 
T1 line) gives you a full-time, high-speed connection to the Internet. If 
you expect a lot of traffic on your WebSite server, you should consider 
a dedicated line, which requires an additional piece of hardware, a 
router, to handle Internet traffic. If you already have full-time access to 
the Internet from your computer, you probably have a dedicated line. 
Check with your network administrator to make sure your computer is 
configured correctly and that you have the correct IP address.
<p>
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) is a specialized type of 
phone line that can be used for both voice and data (at the same time). 
If ISDN is available from the local phone company, an ISDN line can 
work for either an on-demand (PPP/SLIP) or full-time (dedicated line) 
network and achieve speeds as great as some leased-line connections. 
ISDN connections require a special piece of hardware similar to a 
modem.
</DL>
<h3> Internet Email Address of the WebSite Administrator</h3>
During installation WebSite requests the Internet email address for the 
WebSite server administrator. This address includes a name and a 
domain name. The easy way to spot an Internet email address is to 
look for the @ separating two names. For example, 
<i>website@ora.com</i> is the email address for WebSite customer
service.
<p>
The email address can be for any location, not necessarily the system 
on which the WebSite server resides. Also, the email address is for the 
WebSite administrator, not the system administrator (although it may 
be the same person and thus the same address). This email address is 
used in a few WebSite documents, such as search forms.
<h3> Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)</h3>
In addition to a unique numeric address (the IP number), every 
computer that is on a TCP/IP network (internal or Internet) may also 
have a unique name, called a domain name. For example, 
<i>website.ora.com, www.ncsa.uiuc.edu,</i> and <i>www.census.gov</i> are 
domain names used to identify computers connected to the Internet. You'll 
notice that these names have multiple pieces separated by periods (or 
dots, as they are generally called). The first piece in these domain 
names is the hostname; the rest is the name of the domain in which 
the host exists. 
<p>
For WebSite, you need to know the fully qualified domain name for 
your server. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) includes the full 
hierarchical name of the computer--that is, the hostname and the name 
of the domain. An FQDN is written from the most specific address (a 
hostname) to the least specific address (a top-level domain). 
Sometimes fully qualified domain names are called fully qualified 
hostnames (FQHN). The designations mean the same thing, and you 
may find them used interchangeably in this book and in other WebSite 
support materials.
<p>
So if your server's hostname is <i>happy</i> and the domain is 
<i>dopey.com,</i> then your server's FQDN is <i>happy.dopey.com.</i> 
Either your Internet Service Provider or network administrator can 
provide you with the FQDN for your WebSite server.
<h3> Domain Name System (Optional)</h3>
While domain names are easier for people to remember, computers on 
the Internet use the numeric IP addresses to communicate with each 
other. Mapping IP addresses to fully qualified domain names is the job 
of the Domain Name System (DNS). Domain name servers are set up 
around the Internet to provide IP information when you submit a 
request using a domain name rather than an IP address.
<p>
Having DNS available for your WebSite server makes interactions 
with the Internet faster. To use DNS, you must configure TCP/IP with 
addresses for DNS name servers. Again, if you are on a TCP/IP 
network (internal or Internet), this is probably already configured for 
you. Ask your Internet Service Provider or network administrator for 
these addresses.
<h3> DNS Registration of WebSite Server (Optional)</h3>
Your Internet service provider or network administrator will know 
how to register your server's name with DNS. Registering with DNS 
makes it faster for browsers to find your WebSite server. It has no 
effect on how well your server performs, but it will affect how fast 
others can reach the information on your web.
<h2> Add-ons and Application Development Tools</h2>
Depending on how you plan to use your web, you may want to install 
some additional software. Add-on applications let you enhance your 
web with specialized elements (such as graphics, video, and audio) 
and functionality (forms processing, conferencing) to your web. 
Application development tools are essential for writing CGI programs. 
<p>
The following lists are by no means comprehensive. However, they 
include some of the most useful tools readily available on the Web as 
shareware or commercially from a software vendor. Web technology is 
changing daily and new add-ons, plug-ins, and programming 
environments will be continually appearing. Look for your favorites 
the next time we publish this list!
<p>
<h3> Add-on Applications for WebSite</h3>
Add-on applications let you add interest and functionality to your web. 
Full-color images, video, and audio elements require tools to create 
and preview. Web utilities help you monitor and fine-tune your 
server's performance and analyze the information you gather from 
visitors to your web. Adding interactivity to your web, processing form 
data, and other capabilities require programs beyond those included 
with WebSite. Here's a list of some of our favorites for completing 
these objectives; check WebSite Central for others: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>
PolyForm, from O'Reilly &amp; Associates, for constructing web 
forms and processing the submitted data without writing CGI 
programs
<p>
<li>
WebBoard, from O'Reilly &amp; Associates, for adding threaded 
conferencing to your web
<p>
<li>
LView Pro, Paint Shop Pro, Adobe Photoshop, and Corel PhotoPaint 
for creating, editing, converting, and viewing full-color images
<p>
<li>
Real Audio, Sound Recorder, and Gold Wave for creating, editing, 
and reviewing audio files (requires a sound card)
<p>
<li>
QuickTime and MPEGPlay for creating and viewing MPEG 
movies
<p>
<li>
Adobe Acrobat Exchange, Distiller (available in Acrobat Pro), or 
Amber for creating and viewing PDF files.
</ul>
<h3> Application Development Tools</h3>
To write and execute Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs on 
your web, you need a few additional pieces of software. CGI programs 
allow you to execute operations in other Windows, NT shell, or DOS 
applications and return the data to the web browser. For example, you 
may have a Microsoft Access database of customer information, which 
is updated often and needs to be readily available to your sales people. 
First, you write a CGI program in Visual Basic or Delphi to execute a 
query on the database. Then you attach the CGI program to a URL. To 
run the CGI program, the user simply asks a web browser for that 
URL. The URL points to the CGI program, which executes the query 
and returns the answer to the browser. CGI programming is 
thoroughly covered in Chapters 15 through 18.
<p>
Depending on what type of programs you write and use on your web, 
you may need the following software:
<p>
<DL>
<DT>
<b>Visual Basic development environment (Visual Basic Professional 4.0 
recommended)</b>
<DD>
Used for writing CGI programs, including ones that execute other 
Windows applications such as Microsoft Access, WordPerfect, or 
Lotus 123. The Professional version is recommended, and is required 
for any serious database work. Visual Basic 4.0 is also recommended 
because it is a full 32-bit application. You do not need the Visual Basic 
environment to run Windows CGI programs, such as those included 
with WebSite or ones you may get from other sources. See Chapter 16, 
<i>Developing Applications with Windows CGI,</i> for more 
information.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Visual C++ programming language</b>
<DD>
Used for writing CGI programs in Visual C++. This powerful 
programming language adds even more capabilities to your web. 
Visual C++ 2.x is recommended. See Chapter 17, <i>Developing 
Windows CGI Applications with C++ and MFC.</i>
<p>
<DT>
<b>Java Developer's Kit</b>
<DD>
Used for creating Java applets for your web. Java is a new 
programming language designed for the Internet. It is small, robust, 
and architecture neutral. You can download the JDK from Sun 
Microsystems' web site. 
<p>
<DT>
<b>Delphi programming environment</b>
<DD>
Used for writing CGI programs. Developed by Borland International, 
Delphi is an object-oriented programming environment available in 
both 16-bit and 32-bit versions. Delphi allows you to create Windows 
CGI programs quickly and easily. Creating CGI programs with Delphi 
follows the same principles as creating CGI programs with any other 
development environment (such as Visual Basic). See Chapter 16 for 
more information.
<p>
<DT>
<b>NT Perl programming language</b>
<DD>
Used to create and execute Perl-based CGI programs. Perl is a 
high-level programming language that has strong text and file manipulation 
features and is well suited to most CGI programming tasks. In fact, 
Perl is often called the "Swiss Army Chainsaw of Programming."
Many CGI programs that run on UNIX-based web servers are written 
in Perl and are readily available on the Internet. An updated version of 
NT Perl, which also runs under Windows 95 and supports sockets as 
file handles, is available on WebSite Central. See Chapter 18, <i>The 
Standard and DOS CGI Interfaces,</i> for more information. 
<p>
<DT>
<b>POSIX shell and tools from the Windows NT Resource Kit 3.5</b>
<DD>
Used for running CGI programs in the POSIX subsystem. These 
scripts have usually been developed for the UNIX Korn shell. Note 
that supporting tools such as sed and awk are not included in the 
Resource Kit, but ports of these tools are available from other sources. 
See Chapter 18 for more information.
</DL>
<h2> Service or Application?</h2>
The WebSite server can be run as a system service or as a desktop 
application, under either Windows NT or Windows 95. There is no 
difference in performance or operation of the server or related tools. 
You can change how WebSite is running at any time through the 
Server Admin application.
<p>
The advantage of running WebSite as a service is that it runs when no 
one is logged onto the computer (a security feature), and it can restart 
automatically without someone having to log in and launch it (such as 
after a power failure). Under Windows NT 3.51, you can set up 
WebSite to display or not display its icon when it runs as a service. 
Under Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0, the WebSite server icon 
appears in the system Tray of the Task bar. To run as a service under 
Windows NT, WebSite must have administrator privileges.
<p>
With WebSite as a desktop application, you can start it manually or 
have it start automatically whenever you log in (by placing it in your 
startup group). Although WebSite will not stay running when you log 
out, you can leave it running and simply lock your screen to prevent 
unauthorized use. The advantage of running WebSite as an application 
is that it is easier to stop and start, an advantage when you are initially 
setting up or administering the server and web.
<p>
Unless you are familiar with Windows NT services and the identity 
issues involved, we recommend you start by using WebSite as a 
desktop application. You will find it easier to set up initially and can 
switch it to a service later. If you are already using several other 
services on your computer and are familiar with how they work, you 
may prefer to run WebSite as a service from the beginning.
