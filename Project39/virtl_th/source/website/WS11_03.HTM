<h1>Chapter 3 <br> Installing WebSite</h1>
</center>
Before starting installation, you'll need to collect some information 
about your hardware, software, connectivity, and other options before 
you can begin to install WebSite. This information is described in 
<a href="ws11_02.htm">Chapter 2,<i> Before You Start.</i></a> With that 
information and a properly configured system and Internet connection 
(either dialup or through a network), installing WebSite is a simple 
job handled by the setup program.
<p>
Installing WebSite takes only a few minutes. Following installation, 
you must test the server. These tests include making sure the server is 
running and testing the server from both the local computer and a 
remote computer. Running these tests is important to ensure that the 
server is installed correctly and operating properly.
<p>
During installation, WebSite uses the information you provide as well 
as information from your Windows 95 or Windows NT system 
Registry and configuration files to set the basic parameters for the 
server. This general information is recorded in the General property 
sheet page of Server Admin. 
<p>
This chapter begins with a quick start summary, followed by detailed 
installation instructions for both a new installation of WebSite 1.1 and 
an upgrade from WebSite 1.0 for Windows 95 and Windows NT. 
Next, it walks through the server tests and the general information 
included in Server Admin. Finally, it tells you how to activate the 
administrator's account, install WebSite as a service, and where to find 
help.
<h2> Quick Start Summary</h2>
Take the following steps to install and test WebSite. These steps are 
explained fully in the next sections.
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
Depending on how you received the software, some of these steps may
differ.
</blockquote>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Complete the WebSite Installation Requirements checklist (see 
<a href="ws11_02.htm">Chapter 2</a>). You may need to ask your 
network administrator or Internet Service Provider for information 
about the Connectivity section.
<p>
<li>
If you are upgrading from a previous version of WebSite, make backup 
copies of the DENNY and EIT Registry keys. 
<p>
<li>
If you are running other Windows applications, close them before 
starting installation.
<p>
<li>
Start the WebSite Setup program by opening the WebSite
folder on the distribution media with File Manager or Windows Explorer
and double-clicking setup.exe.  
<p>
<li>
Enter your name and company or organization information to 
personalize your copy of WebSite.
<p>
<li>
Choose the destination directory for the WebSite software.
<p>
<li>
If you have an existing web document structure, provide the full 
pathname for the existing document root.
<p>
<li>
Choose the server run mode.
<p>
<li>
Enter the Fully Qualified Domain Name for the server.
<p>
<li>
Enter the Administrator's email address.
<p>
<li>
Test the server's operation from the local computer.
<p>
<li>
Test the server's operation from a remote computer.
<p>
<li>
Run the server self-test.
<p>
<li>
Review the General page of Server Admin.
<p>
<li>
Activate the WebSite server administrator account.
<p>
<li>
Follow the links on the WebSite Resources page.
</ol>
<h2> Installing the WebSite Software</h2>
WebSite is distributed in several ways:  diskettes, CD-ROM,
downloadable self-extracting file, or pre-loaded on your computer's
hard disk.  Depending on the medium used for your copy of WebSite, you
may need to adjust the following instructions.  The 
software includes the WebSite Server and Server Admin software; the 
WebSite applications Map This! Image Map Editor, WebView, and 
WebIndex; and WebSite Resources, a collection of valuable information,
links to other resources,  and the server's self-test.  These 
components are installed by the WebSite Setup program.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
<br>
You must have installed TCP/IP as a network protocol in order for 
WebSite to operate, even if you don't plan to allow Internet access. For 
more information on installing TCP/IP in Windows NT or Windows 
95, see your Windows documentation. 
</blockquote>
<p>
<h3> Performing a New Installation</h3>
The following procedures will install the WebSite software. Read each 
installation screen for instructions and information. Some of the steps 
listed are specific to a Windows NT or Windows 95 installation. 
<p>
To install WebSite for the first time, complete these steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Start your computer and log on to Windows NT or Windows 95. If you 
are installing WebSite under Windows NT, you must be the 
Administrator or have Administrator privileges.
<p>
<li>
If you received the software on diskettes, insert Disk 1 into the
first 3.5" drive (A or B) on your system.  If you received the
software on CD-ROM, insert the CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.
<p>
<li>
Start the WebSite Setup program by opening the <i>WebSite</i> folder
on the distribution media in the File Manager (NT) or Windows Explorer
(Windows 95) and double-clicking on the file <i>Setup</i> (or
<i>Setup.exe</i>).
<p>
<li>
The WebSite Setup program displays the welcome screen. Click Next 
to begin installation.
<p>
<li>
In the Registration window, enter your name and company or 
organization information to personalize your copy of WebSite. Click 
Next to continue. (See Figure 3-1.)

<hr>
<p>
<li>
WebSite asks you to confirm this information. Choose Yes to continue, 
or No to reenter the information.
<p>
<li>
Choose the installation directory for the WebSite software. The default 
is <i>\WebSite</i>, but you can install the software in another directory. 
Click Next to accept the default, or click Browse to choose another 
directory.
<p>
<li>
If you don't have an existing web on your computer, accept the defaults 
for the document root and home page in the Existing Web dialog box. 
(See Figure 3-2.) If you do have an existing web, type the root 
directory of your web documents and the name of your index document. 
<p>

</center>
<hr>
<p>
<li>
Choose how you want the WebSite server to run in the Server Run 
Mode dialog box. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
<br>
If you choose to install WebSite as a service under Windows NT, you 
should be well-acquainted with the subject of Windows NT identity. 
By default, a service assumes the identity of the system account (you 
can change this on the services control panel). WebSite requires this 
default setup to run properly. If you encounter problems running 
WebSite check the identity of the server's account and make sure it is 
the system account. We also recommend you first test WebSite as a 
desktop application.
</blockquote>
<p>
If installing under Windows NT, choose one of the following (see
Figure 3-3):
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Application (manual start). Installs the WebSite server as an 
application that you must start each time you log in to Windows NT. 
This is the default setting.
<p>
<li>
Application (login start). Installs the WebSite server as an application 
in the Startup Group, causing it to start automatically when you login 
to Windows NT.
<p>
<li>
Service (invisible). Installs the WebSite server as a service. The 
WebSite server icon does not appear on the Desktop.
<p>
<li>
Service (icon visible). Installs the WebSite server as a service. The 
WebSite server icon appears on the Desktop, and you can interact with 
it. If you are installing under NT 4.0, the icon is placed in the Tray. 
You can later change it to a Task Bar icon, if desired.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<li>
Application (login start). Installs the WebSite server as an application 
in the Startup folder, causing it to start automatically when you log in 
to Windows 95. The server icon appears in the Tray, but you can later 
change it to appear on the Task Bar, if desired.
<p>
<li>
Service (system start). Installs the WebSite server as a service. The 
server icon appears in the Tray, but you can later change it to appear 
on the Task Bar, if desired.
</ul>
<p>
<li>
Enter the host's fully qualified domain name in the Host's Domain 
Name dialog box and then click Next (Figure 3-4). The domain name 
includes the server's specific name and the larger domain name, such 
as myserver.mycompany.com. This is the name used in URLs to reach 
your WebSite server and is also called the Fully Qualified Domain 
Name (FQDN). If you don't have an FQDN for your server, use the IP 
address (for example, 123.333.222.123).

<li>
Enter an email address that WebSite will use for mailto: URLs in the 
Administrator's Email Address dialog box. This address can be at your 
site or at another site. For example, your website might be 
<i>comp-bear.com</i> but your email might be received at 
<i>tech.comp-bear.com</i>. Use the address at which email is received, 
and then click Next. 
<p>
<li>
The WebSite Setup program installs the software on your system. The 
program displays progress indicators and tells you which files are

make any changes, be sure you are familiar with ``identity'' under 
Windows NT. 
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>
Under Windows NT, Setup next displays information about the 
Windows NT Performance Monitor (Figure 3-6). The Performance 
Monitor gives you information about the performance of your system 
and selected programs and services. For more information about using

this chapter.
<h3> Upgrading from a Previous Version of WebSite</h3>
If you are upgrading from a previous version of WebSite, you need to 
perform the following actions:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Back up the Registry keys 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Denny and 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\EIT. Use the Registry 
editor (<i>regedt32.exe</i> or <i>regedit.exe</i>) supplied with Windows NT 
or Windows 95 to export or save each of these keys and their subtrees. 
These programs are usually installed in your <i>\Windows</i> directory. Save 
the keys under a new name.
<p>
<li>
If you are upgrading from a previous installation that was installed 
as a Windows NT service, check the identity under which WebSite is 
running. If you run as an application, WebSite assumes the identity of 
the person currently logged on. As a service, it assumes a separate 
identity, which by default is the system account, configurable by the 
control panel.
<p>
<li>
Back up your entire WebSite installation, from the server root on 
down. If something goes wrong with the update installation, you'll be 
glad you did this!
</ul>
<p>
After you've completed the actions in the above list, perform these 
steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Start your computer and log on to Windows NT or Windows 95. If you 
are installing WebSite under Windows NT, you must be the 
Administrator or have Administrator privileges.
<p>
<li>
Make sure the WebSite server is not running.
<p>
<li>
If you received the software on diskettes, insert Disk 1 into the
first 3.5" drive (A or B) on your system.  If you received the
software on CD-ROM, insert the CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.
<p>
<li>
Start the WebSite Setup program by opening the <i>WebSite</i> folder
on the distribution media in the File Manager (NT) or Windows Explorer
(Windows 95) and double-clicking on the file <i>Setup</i> (or
<i>Setup.exe</i>).
<p>
<li>
The WebSite Setup program displays the welcome screen. Click Next 
to begin installation.
<p>
<li>
In the Registration window, enter your name and company 
information to personalize your copy of WebSite and click Next.
<p>
<li>
WebSite asks you to confirm this information. Choose Yes to continue, 
or No to reenter the information.
<p>
<li>
The Setup program displays the Updating Existing Installation dialog 
box (Figure 3-8). This dialog box shows the location of the existing 
WebSite software, and warns you that the format of WebIndex files 
has changed. You'll need to rebuild your indexes after installing this 
update.

The program displays progress indicators and tells you which files are 
being installed. Setup also adds information to your Windows 
Registry.
<p>
<li>
The setup program displays the Windows CGI Update dialog box 
(Figure 3-9). For more information about CGI programming, see 
Section 4 of this book.

When complete, Setup displays the WebSite Setup Complete dialog 
box (See Figure 3-7). You can view the README file and start WebSite. 
Click Finish to close the Setup program.
</ol>
<p>
You're now ready to begin testing the installation as described in the 
next sections. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
<br>
Remember to rebuild your indexes with the new version of WebIndex. 
For information on using WebIndex, see Chapter 6, <i>Indexing and 
Searching Your Documents.</i>
</blockquote>
<h2> Testing the WebSite Server</h2>
After installing WebSite, you must test the server to verify that it is 
installed and operating properly. The verification test has four 
parts:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Making sure the server starts properly
<p>
<li>Viewing a WebSite document from the local computer
<p>
<li>Viewing a WebSite document from a remote computer
<p>
<li>Running the server self-test and demonstration (from the default 
home page)
</ul>
<p>
<h3> Is the Server Running?</h3>
When you finish WebSite Setup, the first test is to make sure the 
WebSite server starts and stays running. If you asked Setup to start 
WebSite when it finished, the server should be running. Depending on 
how you chose to run WebSite during setup, the server icon should 
appear on your screen if the server started with no problems. If you 
can see the icon on your screen, then the server has passed the first 
test--it's running. The icon title indicates the server's status as idle or 
busy. Note that under Windows 95, the server's icon may be in the 
Tray portion of the Task bar. To see its status in a pop-up label, move 
the mouse cursor over the server icon in the Tray.
<p>
If the icon doesn't appear and you asked Setup to start the server, then 
you may have elected to run the server as a service with no desktop 
icon (under Windows NT only). To check that the server is running, 
open the Services settings in the Control Panel. Scroll through the list 
of services until you see Web Server and check the status. If it says 
``started,'' the server is running and has passed the first test.
<p>
If you didn't ask Setup to start the server, you must do so now. Under 
Windows 95, click on the WebSite Server item (in the WebSite 1.1 
program folder of the Start menu). Under Windows NT, double-click 
on the WebSite Server icon in the WebSite 1.1 program group (if you 
are using Windows NT 4.0 with the new user interface shell, follow 
the Windows 95 instruction). The server should start and minimize to 
an icon on the desktop.
<p>
If the server does not start, check the server log (in the logs directory 
of WebSite) for possible reasons. The most common is that TCP/IP is 
not configured properly. Also see Appendix C, <i>Troubleshooting 
Tips.</i>
<h3> Can You View a WebSite Document from the Local Computer?</h3>
The easiest way to test if your computer and WebSite are set up 
correctly is with a Web browser. To test your setup, follow these 
steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Make sure your TCP/IP connection is open. If you are on a TCP/IP 
network or have a dedicated connection to the Internet, this is probably 
transparent to you. If you are on a standalone computer and get your 
TCP/IP connectivity with a dial-up SLIP or PPP account, make sure 
that the connection is working.
<p>
<li>
Make sure your WebSite server is running (as described in the 
preceding section).
<p>
<li>
With your Web browser, open the following file (use Open or Open 
Location from the File menu):
<p>
<pre>	file:///C:/WebSite/wsdocs/index.html
</pre>
<p>
(Use the drive letter and WebSite directory appropriate for your 
installation.) 
<p>
<li>
The browser displays the server's Welcome page file, as shown in 
Figure 3-10. However, displaying this document does not verify that 
the server is working because the browser did not find it by contacting 
the server. (You can view local files in a browser without using the 
server.)
<p>
<hr>
<i>Figure 3-10: WebSite Resources Welcome Page</i>
<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="figs/WS11_0310.gif" ALT="(IMAGE)">
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<li>
Select the hypertext link Click Here in the Important paragraph. The 
link is for the URL
<p>
<pre>	http://localhost/wsdocs/index.html
</pre>
<p>
The browser sends out the request for this URL, which is interpreted 
by the browser and server as the Welcome page document on the local 
computer. (Note that using localhost in a URL won't work when you 
try to reach your server from another computer.)
<p>
If the server and computer are set up correctly, the server's Welcome 
page again appears in the browser window, as shown in Figure 3-10. 
This time, however, the browser contacted the server and the server 
returned the document. The URL field shows the URL 
<i>http://localhost/wsdocs/index.html.</i>
<p>
<li>
Next, test the server using the IP address. In the URL field of the 
browser, type in the URL for the server's Welcome page, using the 
following format:
<p>
<pre>	http://server.IP.address/wsdocs/index.html
</pre>
<p>
where <i>server.IP.address</i> is the IP address of your server, such as 
123.234.29.1. The browser should display the same document as 
shown in Figure 3-10, except that the URL field displays the URL with 
the server's IP address.
<p>
<li>
If your server's domain name is registered with DNS, test the server 
using the domain name. In the URL field of the browser, type in the 
URL for the server's Welcome page, using the following format:
<p>
<pre>	http://your.server.name/wsdocs/index.html
</pre>
<p>
where <i>your.server.name</i> is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of 
your server, such as <i>www.comp-bear.com</i>. The browser should display 
the document shown in Figure 3-10, except that the URL field displays 
the URL with the server's name.
</ol>
<h3> Can You View a WebSite Document from Another Computer?</h3>
The next step in testing the server is to view a document on your 
WebSite server from a different computer, either one on your internal 
network or one connected to the Internet. This test is essentially the 
same as the previous one, only from a different location. To complete 
this test you must have access to another computer that has a working 
Web browser. 
<p>
To test the WebSite server from another computer, follow these 
steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Make sure your WebSite server is running.
<p>
<li>
From the other computer, launch a Web browser such as Spyglass 
Mosaic or Netscape Navigator.
<p>
<li>
Specify the URL for your server's Welcome page, using the following 
format:
<p>
<pre>	http://server.IP.address/wsdocs/index.html
</pre>
<p>
where <i>server.IP.address</i> is the IP address of your server. The browser 
uses the URL to locate your WebSite server. If everything is set up 
correctly, you will see the WebSite Welcome page (Figure 3-10).
<p>
<li>
If your server's domain name is registered with DNS, test the server by 
specifying the URL again, using the following format:
<p>
<pre>	http://your.server.name/wsdocs/index.html
</pre>
<p>
where <i>your.server.name</i> is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of 
your server. If everything is set up correctly, you will see the WebSite 
Welcome page (Figure 3-10), with the domain name in the URL 
field.
</ol>
<p>
If you performed this test from a computer on your local network and 
it does not work, make sure the server is running and then check the 
TCP/IP configuration of the computer and the network. If you continue 
to have difficulties, consult your network or system administrator.
<p>
If you conducted this test from a computer connected to the Internet 
and it failed, try again. Sometimes heavy traffic on the Internet can 
cause connections to time-out. If after several tries you still cannot 
reach the server, recheck the TCP/IP connections on both computers. 
Also make sure your server's name is a fully qualified domain name 
and that it is registered with DNS. If you continue to have difficulties, 
consult your Internet service provider.
<h3> Running the Server Self-Test and Demonstration</h3>
So far you have tested that the server is running, that it can serve 
documents locally, and that the IP address and/or hostname is 
resolving correctly. Now it's time to put the server through its paces by 
running the server self-test. This last test has two primary benefits: 
first, it tests that the server is configured correctly and that all the 
features are working; second, it introduces you to the server's many 
capabilities. 
<p>
Depending on what you plan to do with your WebSite server, the self-
test can provide valuable examples and plentiful ideas. Note that some 
of the items in the server self-test are quite advanced. Don't worry if 
you don't understand them at first. The rest of this book is dedicated to 
explaining WebSite's features and how (and why!) you use them. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
<br>
Since you will want to run the self-test and demonstration more than 
once (for example, whenever you make major configuration changes to 
your web or to collect data for troubleshooting problems), we created a 
checklist that includes all the server's features tested. You can find the 
checklist in Appendix A; we recommend you photocopy it, date it, and 
then complete it as you work through the self-test.
</blockquote>
<p>
To start the WebSite self-test and demonstration, do one of the 
following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>In your Web browser, open the URL 
<i>http://localhost/wsdocs/32demo/.</i>
<p>
<li>From the WebSite Resources, or server's Welcome, page (see Figure
3-10), click on the link to <i>Server Self-Test and Demonstration.</i>
</ul>
<p>
Note the checklist near the beginning of the self-test. If you are not 
currently able to meet all these requirements (for example, you may 
not have all the viewers or programming languages installed), we still 
recommend you complete the self-test. Just note that some features will 
not work correctly. For example, if your browser is not configured for 
sound, you will receive an error message when you test the audio link. 
Such an error is not a server problem, it only indicates that your 
browser could be configured differently.
<p>
Remember to record the server's responses to each item in the self-test 
on a copy of the checklist from Appendix A. If you encounter too 
many errors, please read the Frequently Asked Questions, available 
from the Welcome page. 
<h2> Using the Server's Control Menu</h2>
Although powerful and fully-featured, the server requires very little 
attention from you. In fact, it has very few commands available to you 
directly, since all server configuration is done through the Server 
Admin application. The server's Control menu lists only three items: 
Properties, Pause, and Exit. You can display the server's Control menu 
by maximizing the server's icon or by single-clicking on the 
minimized server icon with the right mouse button (Windows 95) or 
the left mouse button (Windows NT).
<p>
The three Control menu items include:
<p>
<DL>
<DT>
<b>Properties</b>
<DD>
Displays the server's property sheet. You can change 
the server's configuration on the property sheet (also called the Server 
Admin application). The server's general properties are covered in the 
following section of this chapter; the other properties are covered 
thoroughly in Section 3 of this book.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Pause</b>
<DD>
Lets you pause the server without exiting it. Pausing the 
server is useful for quick updates to your web or for server 
maintenance. When you pause the server, a dialog box pops up in 
which you can enter a message that users requesting documents from 
your web will see. (Note that some browsers replace this message with 
their own error message.) This message lets the user know that the 
server is only temporarily offline. 
<p>
If you are running WebSite as a service under Windows NT, the Pause 
item is not available from the WebSite Control menu. You must use 
the Services Control Panel or the utility wsctl. See 
<a href="#service">Running WebSite as a Service,</a> later in this chapter.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Exit or Close</b>
<DD>
Stops the server and closes the application. Once the 
server exits, users receive no messages when they request 
documents.
</DL>
<h2> Reviewing WebSite's General Properties</h2>
During installation, WebSite puts specific information about your 
server in the Windows 95 or Windows NT Registry. This 
configuration information is used by many of the WebSite 
applications, including Server Admin, which you use to administer the 
server. We will deal with Server Admin in great detail in Section 3 of 
this book, but for now, let's take a look at the most general information 
included there. You may need to make changes to the general setup at 
some point and this will acquaint you with the particulars. Also, if you 
choose to change whether WebSite runs as a service or a desktop 
application under Windows NT, you need to make that change 
here.
<p>
To view the general information, launch Server Admin from the 
WebSite program list or group. The General page is displayed, as 
shown in Figure 3-11. 
<p>

<hr>
<p>
The top of the page provides information about your WebSite 
server:
<p>
<DL>
<DT>
<b>Working Directory</b>
<DD>
Indicates where WebSite is installed. This 
directory is also called the server root. We discuss this concept in 
detail in Chapter 9, <i>Mapping.</i> Do not change this entry unless you 
move WebSite to a new location.
<p>
<DT>
<b>CGI Temporary Directory</b>
<DD>
Indicates the temporary location 
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs use. CGI programs are 
discussed in detail in Section 4. You can change this directory if 
necessary by typing in a new one.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Administrator Address</b>
<DD>
Shows the complete email address of the 
WebSite server administrator. Notice that the address is the Internet 
address you entered during setup. You can change the address here by 
typing in a new one.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Run Mode</b>
<DD>
Specifies how WebSite will run the next time it is started. If you want 
to change WebSite's mode from an application to a service, you must 
first select a new run mode and then restart the server. For running 
WebSite as a service under NT, see the instructions later in this 
chapter.
<p>
Under Windows 95 there are four run modes: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Application (minimized), login or manual start with the server icon in 
the Task Bar
<p>
<li>
Application (tray), login or manual start with the server icon in the 
Tray
<p>
<li>
System service (minimized), continuously running with the server icon 
in the Task Bar
<p>
<li>
System service (tray), continuously running with the server icon in the 
Tray
</ul>
<p>
Under Windows NT 3.51 there are three run modes: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Application (minimized), login or manual start with the server icon on 
the Desktop (the default)
<p>
<li>
System Service (hidden), continuously running with no server icon
<p>
<li>
System Service (minimized), continuously running with the server 
icon on the Desktop
</ul>
<p>
Under Windows NT 4.0 two additional run modes let you choose to 
show the server's icon in the Tray for both service and application.
</DL>
<p>
The rest of the page provides information about your WebSite server's 
network connections:
<p>
<DL>
<DT>
<b>Normal Port</b>
<DD>
Tells the server what port number to use. The normal 
(TCP/IP) port is 80. Unless you know what you are doing, don't 
change this number.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Timeouts (Receive and Send)</b>
<DD>
Fairly standard settings. You may 
need to increase the timeouts if you are on a slow line, or if users 
complain that your server seems "slow" or "cuts off" documents. 
Increase the timeouts to 180 seconds for a PPP/SLIP connection.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Maximum Simultaneous Connects</b>
<DD>
Limits the number of 
simultaneous connections. You may need to adjust this for your line 
speed, to guarantee a minimum level of service. For example, if you 
have a 28.8 line and 10 simultaneous connections, each user sees only 
a 2800 baud line, which is very slow for Web traffic. In this case, you 
would want to decrease the number of maximum connects. If you are 
on a high-speed line (ISDN, T1, or T3) or running on an internal 
network, the number can be higher.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Hold Connections Open for Re-Use</b>
<DD>
Specifies whether or not the server should use the Connection: Keep 
Alive feature. Several browsers support Keep Alive (including 
Spyglass Mosaic) to make the transfer of documents more efficient and 
less time-consuming. This feature permits the browser to reuse a 
connection for fetching inline graphics and other elements that are 
referenced in an HTML document. If your users experience trouble, 
you should experiment with switching this feature on and off.
<p>
<DT>
<b>Winsock Vendor Information</b>
<DD>
Lists the valid Winsock programs 
detected on your system. WebSite uses Microsoft's Winsock Version 
1.1. You cannot change this field.
</DL>
<p>
As you can see, much of the information on this page is rarely 
changed. However, if you have a problem with the server, technical 
support may ask you to change some of the values on this screen. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
<br>
When you make a change to Server Admin and close it, the server is 
updated as soon as the server is idle.  When the update is made, 
you'll hear the computer beep, indicating that the server's 
configuration has been updated. If the server is not running, 
you will not hear a beep, but the configuration is 
in effect the next time you start the server.
</blockquote>
<h2> Activating the Administrator Account</h2>
WebSite comes with a default user account called <i>Admin.</i> This 
account is dormant, meaning it has no password and belongs to no 
groups. To activate the account you must assign a password and add it 
to at least one group. The Admin account is useful for restricting 
certain URLs and server functions to a single account and for remotely 
administering WebSite. (To learn about restricting access to URLs on 
your web, see Chapter 12, <i>Controlling Access to Your Web;</i> for 
instructions on remote administration, see Chapter 14, <i>Remote 
Administration</i>.)
<p>
To activate the administrator account, you must first select a password. 
Then complete these steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Launch Server Admin from the WebSite program list or program 
group and click on the tab for the Users page (Figure 3-12).
<p>
<hr>

<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="figs/WS11_0312.gif" ALT="(IMAGE)">
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<li>
In the Users field, select the user <i>Admin</i> from the pulldown list 
(as shown) and click on the Password button. The Change Password 
dialog appears.
<p>
<li>
Since there is no old password, put the cursor in the New Password 
field and type in the new password. Press TAB and type in the new 
password again. The password is hidden. Press OK when finished.
<p>
<li>
In the Group Membership section of the Users page, highlight 
Administrators in the Available Groups list and press Add. The group 
name moves to the Member Of list. Repeat for the group name Users. 
(You can accomplish the same task by double-clicking on the group 
name.) Figure 3-13 shows this section with the group memberships 
assigned.

<li>
Press OK to update the server and finish the activation. If the server is 
running, wait for it to beep before trying to use the new account.
</ol>

<h2> Running WebSite as a Service</h2>
You can elect to run WebSite as a service rather than a desktop 
application under Windows 95 or Windows NT. The advantage of 
running WebSite as a service is that it runs even when no one is 
logged on to the computer, a helpful feature if you run your server 24 
hours a day and don't want to leave an open account on an unattended 
computer. In addition, running WebSite as a service allows it to restart 
automatically when the operating system reboots. 
<p>
Under Windows 95, the service mode operates in the same fashion as 
the application mode, except the server runs without anyone being 
logged in. That is, the Control menu options are available for the 
server by clicking on the right mouse button. Under Windows NT, 
however, some of those functions are not available. This section 
discusses how to set up WebSite as a service and how to start, stop, 
pause, and continue the service with a simple utility program.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
<br>
If you are installing WebSite as a service on a Windows NT system, 
you should be well-acquainted with the subject of Windows NT 
identity. By default, a service assumes the identity of the system 
account (you can change this on the services control panel). WebSite 
requires this default setup to run properly. If you encounter problems 
running WebSite, check the identity of the server's account and make 
sure it is the system account. We also recommend you first test 
WebSite as a desktop application.
</blockquote>
<h3> Setting up the Service</h3>
To change WebSite from a desktop application to a system service 
requires only a few quick steps. All the information the operating 
system needs is in place--you simply have to shut down the server as 
an application, make one change in Server Admin, and start it up 
again as a service as described in these steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Exit the WebSite server if it is running.
<p>
<li>
Launch Server Admin and make sure the General page is 
displayed.
<p>
<li>
On the General page, from the Run Mode pulldown list select System 
Service, with the desired icon option. 
<p>
<li>
Close Server Admin.
<p>
<li>
Under Windows 95, start the server from the WebSite Start menu 
folder. The server is now running as a service.
<p>
<li>
Under Windows NT, you must complete some additional steps. In the 
Windows NT Control Panel, open Services.
<p>
<li>
Scroll through the listed services until you come to Web Server, as 
shown in Figure 3-14.
<p>
<hr>
<i>Figure 3-14: Windows NT Services Window</i>
<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="figs/WS11_0314.gif" ALT="(IMAGE)">
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<li>
Highlight Web Server and press Start. Services starts the WebSite 
server and, if you elected to run it with a desktop icon, the server icon 
appears on your screen.
<p>
<li>
If you want WebSite to start automatically whenever the system starts, 
press Startup on the Services window and complete the necessary 
information. Refer to the operating system guide for more help in 
setting up services. 
</ol>
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
<br>
To return WebSite to a desktop application, simply stop the service, 
reset the Run Mode in Server Admin, and launch the server as an 
application.
</blockquote>
<h3> Starting, Stopping, Pausing, and Continuing the Service</h3>
As described in the previous section, under Windows NT you can start 
the WebSite service from the Services window of the Control Panel. In 
addition, a utility program comes with WebSite for Windows NT that 
lets you start, stop, pause, and continue the server from the command 
line. The utility is called <i>wsctrl</i> and is located in the WebSite 
Support directory. 
<p>
You can use <i>wsctrl</i> as a quick alternative to the Control Panel or as 
part of regularly scheduled maintenance activities. If you pause the 
server with <i>wsctrl</i>, the server sends a Service Unavailable message so 
that users know the server is only temporarily offline (this is the same 
effect as using the Pause control option when the server is running as a 
desktop application).
<p>
You run <i>wsctrl</i> from a Command Prompt (depending on how your 
path is set up, you may need to use the full pathname of the program 
or be in the <i>WebSite\support</i> directory). <i>wsctrl</i> requires 
one of the following four options:
<p>
<ul>
<li>start--starts the server as a service
<p>
<li>stop--stops the server
<p>
<li>pause--pauses the server while it is running
<p>
<li>continue--restarts the server from a paused state
</ul>
<p>
If you forget these options, simply type <i>wsctrl</i> at the command prompt 
and the program displays usage information.
