<h1>Chapter 1 <br>  Why Publish with WebSite?</h1>
</center>
<p>
You have information--product literature, technical specs, 
financial data, customer and employee records, employment 
opportunities, schedules of events, reports. The information is in 
a variety of formats--text, graphics, video, audio. People want 
that information--customers, vendors, colleagues, friends, family. 
<p> 
How do you get this varied information into the hands of the right 
people (and keep it out of the hands of the wrong people)? Publish 
it with WebSite, the powerful, fully featured, easy-to-use Web 
server from O'Reilly &amp; Associates.  
<p>
With WebSite you can publish your information directly on the 
Internet and reach the millions of people who use the World Wide 
Web every day. Or, you can use WebSite to publish on an internal 
network and share important company information with the people who 
need it most. You can even use WebSite's virtual server capability 
to publish in both environments with a public web connected to the 
Internet and a private web running on your internal LAN.  
<p>
To administer, build, and manage your web, WebSite comes with a 
complete set of tools. WebView lets you see and develop your web in 
a graphical environment. The HotDog Web Editor lets you create HTML 
files with ease, while MapThis! makes creating clickable image maps 
a breeze. WebIndex lets you create search indexes for all or any 
parts of your web. With Server Admin you configure your server 
through an easy-to-use graphical interface.  
<p>
This book is dedicated to showing you how WebSite works and how you 
can use it to meet your information goals. This first chapter sets 
the stage with ideas for using WebSite, some background on the Web, 
an overview of the WebSite server and tools, and a look at some of 
WebSite's key features.  
<h2> How Can I Use WebSite?</h2>
Running a Web server is essentially a new way to publish 
information. Publishing on the Web differs from traditional 
paper-based publishing by giving you the ability to include 
multimedia elements, to link information from many locations, to 
update and distribute information quickly, and to create virtual 
documents from other sources and applications. Taking these general 
capabilities as a jumping-off point, let's look at some ways you 
might want to use WebSite in publishing your own information.  
<p> 
<ul>
<li>
Whether your business is a global corporation or an independent consultancy, 
WebSite lets you tell other people on the Internet about your 
business. Product and service information, competitive analyses, 
philosophy of business, biographies of key people, employment 
opportunities, press releases, and pricing data are topics you may 
want to include. WebSite's powerful Common Gateway Interface (CGI) 
lets you create forms for interactive contact with visitors to your 
web. Links to and from other webs bring more traffic to your own web.  
<p>
<li>
In a department or office, WebSite is an easy way to make data 
readily available to others on the local area network. For example, 
you have employee records, accounting information, sales 
projections, project plans, and customer data that coworkers need 
to use on a regular basis. You can easily create and maintain web 
documents for these valuable records. If you have existing 
databases and spreadsheets of data to share, you can use WebSite's 
CGI to generate virtual documents with current data from those 
applications. Instead of making a request directly to the 
application, the user gives information to the CGI program through 
a browser. The CGI program makes the request of the application and 
displays the information in a web document. WebSite's full 32-bit 
framework for developing CGI programs to execute Windows 
applications is a powerful tool in building a web. Note, too, that 
this particular application of WebSite is an internal use and does 
not require access to the Internet.  
<p>
<li>
WebSite's virtual server capability lets you host webs for other 
clients, departments, or individuals. Each web has its own IP 
address and is completely separate from the other webs, yet all 
share one copy of WebSite. WebSite's Identity wizard and graphical 
setup of virtual servers is a new feature of Version 1.1.  
<p>
<li>
Often, large companies have frequently updated procedural 
information to share among employees. If you are responsible for 
updating and distributing this information, you know how difficult 
it is to keep track of multiple copies. If you receive updates 
regularly, you know how time-consuming it is to file the new 
procedures and dispose of the old. Putting procedures (or other 
frequently updated information) on a WebSite server solves both 
the updating and distribution problems. Updates are completed once, 
and when the files are added to the WebSite server the distribution 
is complete. The files don't even have to be in HTML; simply 
configure your users' browsers to correctly display or download 
other file types such as Microsoft Word or WordPerfect. For 
sensitive information, WebSite lets you restrict access to 
particular users or groups of users. This solution works well for 
companies with only one location or with many locations around the 
world, since the Internet is an existing global network.  
<p>
<li>
A company with business partners in different buildings, cities, 
states, or around the world can use WebSite to exchange product 
designs, specs, reviews, and progress reports. For example, at 
company headquarters in California, product managers can post 
designs and specs for a manufacturer in Singapore to review and 
download. The factory in Singapore can post responses, revised 
designs (based on capability), and progress reports on their 
WebSite for the company to review and respond to. Exchanging 
information on products under development takes full advantage of 
WebSite's access control restrictions.  
<p>
<li>
Managers required to write and distribute weekly or monthly status 
reports will find WebSite a great time saver. They can write the 
report and make it available on the server. Those who need to read 
it can retrieve it at their convenience, completely eliminating the 
copying and distributing steps.  
<p>
<li>
Setting up a WebSite server can be a great solution for busy 
educators. You can create a web with links to course descriptions, 
current assignments, summer reading lists, and class schedules. 
Your web can also have links to external resources such as 
libraries or databases that your students need for research. A CGI 
program for pulling students' grades from your electronic grade 
book allows your students to always know where they stand in your 
class. Of course, you want to restrict the CGI program's URL to 
require user authentication. Including a mailto URL on a web page 
leaves your students no excuse for not communicating with you.  
<p>
<li>
Clubs, civic organizations, and church groups have information that 
is valuable to members and non-members alike. WebSite is a perfect 
vehicle for publishing that information. You can include the 
history, current events, and biographies of officers and leaders. 
News about special projects or needs can be set up in a What's New 
page. Including links to other sites and resources on the Internet 
helps your members find other useful information. A CGI program can 
be used for collecting and posting comments from members. If the 
club members are far apart, you can use your web for electing 
officers by creating a forms-based ballot requiring user authentication.  
<p>
<li>
If you just want to have fun, use WebSite as a personal server. Put 
up a web about your interests and your life philosophy. Include 
photos, artwork, audio, and video clips. Write a weekly newsletter 
and post it for your family and close friends. Like-minded (or 
possibly unlike-minded) readers will gather around your WebSite and 
create a virtual community. Changing your WebSite often and making 
it interesting (as is true of interactions in any community) is the 
key for a successful personal web.  
</ul> 
<p>
These are just a few ideas; you probably have many more for 
publishing your information. This list referred to several features 
of the Internet, the World Wide Web, and WebSite. Read on to learn 
more about them.  
<h2> How Does It Work?</h2> 
The Internet, the World Wide Web, WebSite. How do they all fit 
together? How do users find your information? To answer these 
questions, take a few minutes to look at the big picture and some 
basic concepts.  
<h3> An Overview</h3>
Figure 1-1 depicts the components of the Internet and 
particularly the World Wide Web.
<p>
<hr>
<i>Figure 1-1: The World Wide Web</i>
<p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="figs/WS11_0101.gif" ALT="(IMAGE)">
</center>
<hr>
<p>
In this illustration, you can see that
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The Internet is a network of networks that spans the globe.
<p>
<li>
The World Wide Web is a collection of linked information on the Internet.
<p>
<li>
Web browsers, such as Spyglass Mosaic or Netscape Navigator, find 
and display information from the Web.
<p>
<li>
Web servers, such as WebSite, house that information and send it to 
the browser when requested.
<p>
<li>
Your information in text, graphic, or multimedia format is the most 
important piece of this picture. Publishing your information is why 
you are setting up a Web server.  
</ul>
<p>
Figure 1-2 seems quite similar to Figure 1-1. 
It shows the same Web components but on an internal network, 
such as a local area network, instead of the Internet--sometimes 
called an intranet. You can use WebSite in either situation: on the 
Internet for public, global use; or on an internal network for 
local, private use.

<h3> Basic Concepts</h3>
Whether you plan to run a public or a private WebSite server, you 
should be familiar with the few basic concepts that make it work. 
As you use WebSite and explore its capability, these concepts will 
become clear. This section describes the concepts, gives you a bit 
of history, and introduces the specifications on which the Web relies.  
<h4> Hypertext</h4>
When Tim Berners-Lee decided to use hypertext technology in 
developing the World Wide Web, he did away with the typical linear 
approach to published material. You're familiar with that: you open 
a book, skim the table of contents, and go to a specific topic. To 
find similar information in the same book, you may have to check 
the index (or a cross-reference) and turn there.  
<p>
Hypertext, on the other hand, allows for many relations within a 
document and between documents. Hypertext links in a web document 
allow the reader to instantly find additional information, which 
may be text, graphics, video, or audio and may be located half a 
world away! ``Web'' is an apt term to picture how hypertext works 
on the Internet, where links can span computers around the globe. 
By using hypertext as a navigational system, users can move freely 
from one document to another, regardless of where the documents are 
located.  
<h4> Web browsers</h4>
The Web is based on client/server architecture. Simply put, a 
server holds documents that a client requests. On the Web, the 
client is called a browser. A Web browser takes a user's request 
(in the form of a URL, explained below), retrieves the document 
from the proper Web server, interprets the contents, and presents 
it to the user. 
<p> 
A graphical Web browser, such as Mosaic, can display text and GIF 
graphics. Web browsers have varying capabilities of manipulating 
the display of text. We recommend you test your web documents on 
several browsers to verify their proper appearance.  
<p>
A Web browser can also be configured to automatically call external 
viewers, such as Lview, Wham, and MPEGPlay, or other applications 
to properly display specific types of documents. Web browsers are 
becoming more sophisticated every day with built-in capabilities. 
It is important that you keep up on browser improvements so that 
the documents on your web take full advantage of new features.  
<h4> Web servers</h4>
The other half of the client/server relationship is the server. On 
the Web, a server houses documents and returns them to a Web client 
when requested. As its name implies, a server ``serves'' up the 
document to the client. The WebSite server is a fully featured Web 
server providing support for multiple IP addresses (virtual 
servers), mapping capabilities, basic user authentication and 
access control, automatic directory listing, and logging. These 
topics are discussed in detail in Section 3 of this book.  
<p> 
Web servers not only return text and multimedia documents to 
browsers, they can also execute special programs that enable them 
to act as gateways to other applications or information resources. 
These programs are called Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs. 
WebSite supports CGIs for the Windows environment, the standard 
(POSIX) environment, and the DOS environment. 
<p>
For example, a WebSite Windows CGI program can execute a request 
for data from a Microsoft Access database or a calculation from a 
Lotus 123 spreadsheet and return the results to the browsers in an 
HTML document. WebSite's full 32-bit support for Windows CGIs makes 
it unique among Web servers. Windows CGIs for WebSite can be 
written with a variety of tools including Visual Basic 4, Visual 
C++, and Delphi. Section 4 of this book provides a detailed 
discussion of CGIs.  
<h4> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h4>
Text documents on the Web are ASCII (plain text) files that contain 
codes of a special tagging language called Hypertext Markup 
Language (HTML). HTML describes the structure of a document but not 
its exact formatting. That is, you can identify some text as a 
top-level heading with a special tag: 
<p>
<pre>&lt;H1&gt;Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)&lt;/H1&gt;
</pre>
<p>
However, how that text looks to the user depends on the browser. 
The head will certainly stand out, but it doesn't mean it will 
appear as 18-point Helvetica boldface while the body text is 
12-point Times Roman. Working with HTML means adjusting your 
thinking away from WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) desktop 
publishing to deciding what role an element plays in your document. 
Is it a head? Is it text? Is it a list? In many ways, HTML 
formatting simplifies the life of an author because if concentrates 
on content, not format.  
<p> 
The most powerful part of HTML is the ability to embed hypertext 
links in documents. As you guessed, links have special tags. HTML 
also includes tags that ask the user for input, either with simple 
questions or complex forms.  
<p>
The current version of HTML is version 2.0. It is based on some of 
the concepts of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language, 
which is an ISO standard used for marking up documents for both 
print and online publication. The next version of the HTML 
specification, HTML 3, will move HTML into full SGML compliance and 
provide more tags. WebSite supports both HTML 2.0 and HTML 3. 
Chapter 5, <i>HTML Tutorial and Quick Reference,</i> covers HTML 
in detail, and also covers HotDog, the HTML editor shipped with WebSite.
<h4> Global addressing: URLs</h4>
With documents residing on Web servers around the world, how do Web 
browsers know where to find a specific document? Every document on 
the Web has a unique address called a Uniform Resource Locator, or 
URL. You can think of URLs as a global addressing system that 
provides several pieces of information to the Web browser.  
<p>
Let's look at the URL for the list of external viewers at the NCSA 
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign:
<p>
<pre>http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/viewers.html
</pre>
<p>
The first part of the URL, <i>http://,</i> tells what protocol is used to 
reach the target server. In this URL the protocol is HTTP, which 
means this is a Web server. (Yes, you can reach FTP servers and 
Gopher servers by using URLs with the correct protocol.) The rest 
of the URL is the path for the document. The server name is first 
(<i>www.ncsa.uiuc.edu</i>), followed by the full URL path of the document 
<i>viewers.html</i>.  
<p> 
The URL path is not necessarily the same as the physical path of 
the file on the server. The URL path is determined by how the web 
is mapped on the server. Chapter 9, <i>Mapping,</i> covers mapping 
in detail; the important thing to remember now is that the physical 
path and the URL path may have absolutely no correlation to each other.
<p>
Often URLs don't include filenames. For example, the URL for 
WebSite Central, the web site dedicated to WebSite information and 
support is: 
<p>
<pre>http://website.ora.com/
</pre>
<p>
With this URL, the browser can locate the server and a directory 
within the server's web, but not a specific document. Which 
document to return is up to the server. If the server has a default 
home page or index file defined, and a file by that name exists in 
the specified URL directory, the server returns that document. If 
the file doesn't exist, the server returns a directory listing. The 
server can also be configured to return nothing to protect 
sensitive information. Automatic directory listing, with its many 
features, is discussed in Chapter 11, <i>Automatic Directory Listings.</i>
<h4> HTTP</h4>
The ``glue'' that holds the Web together is the Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol (HTTP). Web browsers and Web servers use HTTP when 
requesting and returning documents. In HTTP, every document request 
from a Web browser to a Web server is a new connection. For 
example, when a Web browser requests an HTML document from a Web 
server, the connection is opened, the document is transferred, and 
the connection is closed.  
<p>
The current version of HTTP is 1.0 (often written as HTTP/1.0). 
WebSite meets the HTTP/1.0 specification and includes all the 
required features. If you're interested, the HTTP/1.0 specification 
is available through the Tech Center at WebSite Central 
(<i>http://website.ora.com/</i>).
<h3> A Brief History of the World Wide Web</h3>
The World Wide Web originated in 1989 at the European Particle 
Physics Laboratory (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. Tim Berners-Lee, 
an Oxford University graduate who came to CERN with a background in 
text processing and real-time communications, wanted to create a 
new kind of information system in which researchers could 
collaborate and exchange information during the course of a 
project. He saw the need for physicists to collaborate in real 
time, and not just on one project, but on many.  
<p> 
Tim used hypertext technology to link together a web of documents 
that could be traversed in any manner to seek out information. In 
cooperation with others at CERN, Tim defined an Internet-based 
architecture using open, public specifications and free, sample 
implementations for both clients and servers. The team at CERN 
implemented a line-mode browser, which is the lowest common 
denominator among browsers and can be used from almost any kind of 
terminal. Lynx, a browser with a full-screen interface, was later 
developed at the University of Kansas. Although these browsers 
supported the hypertext environment, they did not support graphic 
or multimedia elements.  
<p> 
The widespread appeal of the Web did not come until 1993 with the 
release of Mosaic, a graphical browser. Marc Andreessen, a student 
at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign (UIUC), was 
working part-time at the National Center for Supercomputing 
Applications (NCSA) at the university. His job was to build tools 
for scientific visualization. Out of that work came Mosaic, a Web 
browser with an easy-to-use interface that lets you click on a link 
to navigate the Web, as well as the ability to display graphics. 
Extending Mosaic with external viewers added multimedia capability.  
<p> 
The World Wide Web and graphical browsers have made the Internet 
important beyond the scientific or educational community. Most 
references you see to the Internet in consumer or business-oriented 
settings are to the World Wide Web. Generally you'll see a picture 
of a Web browser showing a home page. The Web has made an exciting 
contribution to the information age. We will continue to see 
refinements to Web servers and browsers and a major shift in the 
information publishing paradigm.  
<h2> What Comes with WebSite?</h2>
WebSite includes the Web server and a full range of tools to manage 
the server and develop your web. This section briefly describes 
those components and also touches on security and performance 
issues, topics which may be of concern to you.  
<p>
<h3> WebSite Server and Tools </h3>
<DL>
<DT><IMG SRC="figs/webserv.gif" ALT="(IMAGE)">
<B>WebSite Server</B>
<DD>
The heart of WebSite, the server handles requests from clients 
(browsers) for documents, whether they be text, graphic, multimedia, or 
virtual. The WebSite server is a full 32-bit, multi-threaded HTTP server 
that runs under Windows NT or Windows 95. The server takes full 
advantage of the operating system's Registry and multithreading 
support.  Under NT, the server can run as an application or 
as a service. Usually the server appears as an icon on 
your desktop or task bar with the status shown as either idle 
or busy. Configuring the server is the job of Server Admin.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="figs/serv_adm.gif" ALT="(IMAGE)">
<B>Server Admin</B>
<DD>
Server Admin lets you configure the WebSite server to meet the needs of 
your environment. Although the install program handles the basic 
configuration, you will probably want to enhance your server by changing 
some settings. Mapping, identities for virtual servers, automatic 
directory listings, access control, and logging parameters are set 
through Server Admin. The General settings in Server Admin are covered 
in <a href="WS11_03.htm">Chapter 3, <I>Installing WebSite</I>;</a>
the other settings are covered in Section 3 (Chapters 9 to 14).
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="figs/webview.gif" ALT="(IMAGE)">
<B>WebView</B>
<DD>
WebView helps you build and manage your web by graphically depicting it. 
WebView shows all hypertext links between and within documents-internal 
or external, broken or complete. WebView not only lets you see your web 
from a bird's eye view, it also lets you edit individual files. In 
WebView you can launch an appropriate editing application based on the 
file's type, or you can drag a file into the desired application using 
WebView's drag and drop capability. If you're building a new web, start 
with WebView. If you are managing an existing web, use WebView to make 
improvements and fix problems. WebView diagnoses HTML coding problems 
and lets you see activity reports on any part of your web. WebView works 
on any web, not just the local one. WebView also includes HTTP proxy 
support to work behind a firewall. WebView is the subject of Chapter 
4, <I>Managing Your Web Using WebView</I>.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="figs/webindex.gif" ALT="(IMAGE)">
<B>WebIndex and WebFind</B>
<DD>
WebIndex and WebFind work together to provide full-text
search capability for users of your web. WebIndex appears in
the WebSite program group or program list while WebFind is
a CGI program. WebIndex lets you create the indexes used
in WebFind searches. Before WebFind can work, you must
run the WebIndex program and indicate which portion of
your Web is to be searchable. You can create multiple
indexes with WebIndex and keep them separate or merge
them. A variety of preferences allow you to tailor index
contents. When users click on a WebFind hypertext link in
one of your documents, WebFind first displays a search form
for the user to complete and then executes the search.
WebIndex and WebFind are covered in Chapter 6, <I>Indexing
and Searching Your Documents</I>.
<P>
<DT>
<IMG SRC="figs/mapthis.gif" ALT="(IMAGE)">
<B>Map This!</B>
<DD>
Clickable image maps-images that have hotspots that send
the user to other locations-are a great addition to any web.
Many webs use clickable image maps on the home page to
help users navigate through the contents of the Web.
Map This! lets you create clickable image
maps easily, in a graphical environment. Map
This! supports both NCSA-file based maps and client side 
image maps supported by some browsers.  Map This! is the topic 
of Chapter 7, <I>Working with Image Maps</I>.
</DL>
<h3> Performance and Security Issues</h3>
Before you make your web available to users either on the Internet 
or on a local area network, you probably have some questions about 
performance and security. How much load can the server handle? Will 
it handle requests fast enough in a busy environment? What will 
cause performance degradation? Will the rest of my files be safe if 
browsers have access to my web? Can I impose additional security? 
If you've asked any of these questions, take a few minutes to read 
this section.  
<h4> Performance</h4>
The WebSite server is as robust as any Web server currently in use. 
Given the same basic hardware setup (network connection, disk 
capacity, disk speed, CPU type and speed), the WebSite server 
performs as well as any other NT- or UNIX-based Web server (and, 
historically, UNIX has been the platform of choice for Internet 
servers). In an equal hardware environment, WebSite is as fast or 
faster and can handle an equal load.  
<p>
In addition, WebSite fully supports symmetric multi-processing. 
Running on a computer with multiple 486 CPUs, the server can 
saturate a T1 line. Running the server on a single Pentium with a 
fast bus would have the same effect. In short, server performance 
is limited only by the hardware being used. To improve performance, 
we recommend upgrading your hardware--both the computer system 
(particularly RAM) and your Internet connection.  
<p>
For a more detailed discussion of WebSite's performance capability 
and the results of performance tests, see the Performance White 
Paper in the Developer's Corner of the Tech Center at WebSite 
Central.  
<h4> Security</h4>
Security is certainly an issue of concern for server 
administrators. Unauthorized access to computers and files on the 
Internet can range from annoying to disastrous depending on the 
intruder's intent and abilities. Even if your web is on a private 
network or otherwise protected, you may still have some security 
concerns.  
<p> 
Although no Internet service is 100% safe, the World Wide Web is 
safer by design. If you think of the Web as a web, the limited 
nature of what a user can see or have access to becomes clear. The 
Web has boundaries, defined by the document links. A Web browser 
doesn't have the capability to freely browse a server; it can only 
view documents that are part of the document tree, beginning with 
the document root. This limitation is controlled by mapping, which 
is the topic of Chapter 9.  
<p> 
In addition, WebSite provides two standard (basic) methods of 
access control, which can be applied to the whole Web or any URL in 
your web: 
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
Class restrictions, which allow or deny access to the Web (or 
portions of the Web) based on the Internet address or hostname of 
the Web browser. Class restrictions are often referred to as IP or 
hostname filtering.  
<p>
<li>
User authentication, which allows or denies access to the Web (or 
portions of the Web) based on a username and password. Usernames 
and passwords are specific to the server and are not related to 
usernames and groups established on your system. Making someone a 
user on your server does not give them an account on your computer.  
</ul>
<p>
Perhaps the best advice we can give to deal with security issues is 
to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity on your server. You 
should also regularly check WebSite Central for security updates.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE</b>
<br>
You may need greater security than the basic security 
provided with WebSite 1.1. For example, if you want to conduct 
credit card transactions over the Web, you may want to use 
encryption-based security. Two protocols provide this enhanced 
security for Web transactions: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and 
S-HTTP (Secure HTTP). Both of these protocols are available in 
WebSite Professional. Please contact O'Reilly &amp; Associates 
Customer Service at 800-998-9938 for information on upgrading to 
WebSite Professional.  
</blockquote>
<h2> What Are Some WebSite Features?</h2>
As you use WebSite, you'll discover many powerful, easy-to-use 
features.  The following list covers some of those features and 
should give you some ideas for using WebSite to meet your 
information publishing needs.  
<p>
Some of the features you'll see in WebSite Version 1.1 include: 
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
Full support for multiple virtual servers (multiple home pages, 
each with its own IP address) through graphical administration and 
in all the WebSite tools 
<p>
<li>
Server has a pause feature to allow for maintenance and more 
elegant shutdowns 
<p>
<li>
The WebSite server can run as a ``service'' under Windows 95, 
allowing the server to run continuously when no one is logged in. 
Under Windows 95, the server icon can appear in the Tray or on the 
Task Bar (regardless of whether you run it as a service or an 
application).  
<p>
<li>
Server supports the Connection: Keep Alive feature implemented by 
the Microsoft Internet Explorer and supported by most other 
browsers, including Spyglass Mosaic (This feature permits browsers 
to reuse connections for fetching inline graphics and other 
elements that are referenced in an HTML document. The Keep Alive 
feature makes transfer of documents more efficient and less time-consuming.) 
<p>
<li>
A manual switch for Keep Alive is available on the General page of 
Server Admin. If the server experiences problems with Keep Alive, 
we recommend you turn off the feature.
<p>
<li>
Preferences in WebView including HTTP proxy support for working behind a

variety of preferences for tailoring index contents
<p>
<li>
Map This! image map editor works with both NCSA file-based image 
maps and client side image maps (processed by the browser)

Server-side includes allow you to splice into an HTML document the 
contents of another HTML document or the value of a variable, such 
as the date or time (WebSite includes a special set of page counter 
server-side includes that indicate how many users have visited your web.) 
<p>
