<spacer  size = 90>This  thesis  is  a  collection  of  the  works  on  Client-Server  relational  database
delvelopment  on  the  finance  system, including  basic  entering  data, noting  an  account,  providing 
funds,  giving  information  and  displaying  reports.
<spacer  size = 90>This  database  development  is  implemented  by  ORACLE  relational  database  system,  
and  the front-end  or   user  interface  is  written  in  DELPHI  which  is  design  to  be  graphic. The  system
has  an  ODBC ( Open  Database  Connectivity )  driver  connecting the  front-end  and  database server .
This  development  is  implemented  from  the  original  work  by  analysis, design, and  install  to make
the  system  more  effective.
