      <font size="2">Documentation Version 2.01</font></font></p>
    <h2><font face="Arial">Welcome</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial">Welcome to SimpleMail 2.01 from Adiscon GmbH.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">This ActiveX control empowers your applications as well as your ASP
    pages to send simple Internet mail messages. Simple mail strictly conforms to the original
    SMTP standard (RFC821/822). It does not support enhanced features like attachments, MIME or multiple
    character sets. However, it offers high performance, ease of use and a very competitive
    low price. SimpleMail was created for our own internal use and is used intensive inside
    our own ASP applications. It was developed based on real world need and we hope, you'll
    find it useful as well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">This documentation covers the version 2.01. Any comments are
    appreciated at <a href="mailto:Info@Adiscon.com">&quot;Info@Adiscon.com&quot;</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Product updates as well as important announcements can be found at
    &quot;<a href="http://www.Adiscon.com">http://www.Adiscon.com/SimpleMail</a>&quot; (if
    that URL ever changes, please try <a href="http://www.Adiscon.com">http://www.Adiscon.com</a>).</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial">Year 2000 Compatibility</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">SimpleMail 2.0 is fully year 2000 compliant.
      SimpleMail only uses dates to generate the &quot;send&quot; header, which
      records when the message has been send. The original SMTP RFC requests
      this header to be written with 2 digit years. Newer implementation allow 4
      digit years. As such, SimpleMail writes 4 digit years since version 1.5.
      Users of SimpleMail 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 need to upgrade to 1.6 in order to be
      fully compliant. Otherwise, 2 digit years will be written. These should be
      correctly interpreted by most systems, but we recommend the upgrade to the
      most recent version (which is free of charge for registered users).
      SimpleMail 1.0&nbsp; are also fully compliant as they don't write an
      &quot;send&quot; header and as such have no date-related coding.</font></p>
    <h2><font face="Arial">Installation</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial">SimpleMail is high performing tool using only minimal system
    resources. It also doesn&#146;t require an extended installation process.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial">System Requirements</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">SimpleMail is developed under Windows NT 4.0 and
    Windows 2000. Although not
    extensively tested under NT 3.5 or Windows 95, we do not see any reason why it
    shouldn&#146;t perform well in this environment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">There is one needed prerequisite in your system software: you need
    to have an Windows Sockets 1.1 (and above) compatible IP stack installed. This will be the
    IP stack included with NT in most cases. However, feel free to use any other stack as long
    as it corresponds to the socket specification.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The freely downloadble version is available for Intel X86 platforms
    only. Versions for the DEC Alpha platfrom are available to registered users free of
      charge. Please allow up to 4 days for delivery of the ALPHA version. Due
      to low demand, we have stopped compiling the ALPHA builds without request.
      So we will create a version as soon as the first customer asks for it.
      This is why we need a sligth delay. Version 1.6 is instantly available for
      ALPHA and will be sent prior to the current version.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial">The Installation Process</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">Actual installation is very straightforward</font><ol>
      <li><font face="Arial">unzip the install set (ISimpMail.zip) to any directory you like. Make
        sure this directory is on a drive local to the system the controls shall be running on.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">run &quot;install.bat&quot;; this registers the SimpleMail ActiveX
        control into your system registry</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Arial">After finishing this simple steps, SimpleMail is set up and ready to
    run.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Please be sure to unzip the install set using a Win32 version of
    PKUNZIP or WinZip (available at <a href="http://www.pkware.com">http://www.pkware.com</a> or <a href="http://www.winzip.com">http://www.winzip.com</a>). The install set contains files
    with long names. If you use a non-Win32 version, this names will be lost and install.bat
    will fail. Also be sure not to move the .dll to any other directory. This will cause the
    ActiveX control to fail. If you need to change directories, uninstall SimpleMail first and
    re-install it from the new directory.</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial">Uninstallation</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial">This is also very straightforward. Just 2 steps:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="Arial">run &quot;uninstall.bat&quot; from the directory where SimpleMail.exe
        is installed</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">delete the files</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial">SimpleMail does not write to the registry. So there is no need to
    clean up things there.</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial">Usage </font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial">SimpleMail needs no further customization - it can be used right
    after installation. SimpleMail is a standard ActiveX control. It can be called from any
    ActiveX compatible container application, most notable the IIS' ASP processor as well as
    Visual Basic (VB).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Use it as follows:</font><ol>
      <li><font face="Arial">Instanciate the control (e. g. with CreateObject)</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">fill in the correct property values</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">call the SendEx method&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">you can re-specify properties and call the sent method as often as
        you want without re-instanciating the control.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">be sure to destry the control as soon as you are done (not required
        by SimpleMail but generally good programming practice).</font></li>

        on the message size. For practical reasons, however, we recommend limiting the size to 5
        to 10 KB. Nevertheless, you can send any size message if you like.</p>

        UUEncoded (or even MIME) files inside the MessageText, as long as the encoding is done by

      <p><font face="Arial">This chapter lists common SMTP status codes as seen in the &quot;LastStatus&quot;
      property. These are derivied from RFC821.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The exact status codes themselfs depend on the mail server talking to.
      As a general rule, a status beginning with 2 means the operation succeeded,
      while a status beginning with 5 means it failed. More complete information
      can be found in RFC821.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We encourage users to act on the &quot;LastStatus&quot;
      property only if the actual codes are well know. For error reporting,
      please use the &quot;LastStatusMessage&quot; property. This read-only
      property holds the status code as well as a descriptive message. That
      message was generated by the SMTP server and as such can be assumed to
      point to the exact cause of the problem.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">If you are paying in US$, your check must be drawn on an US American
    bank and made payable to &quot;Rainer Gerhards&quot; (very important, do not make payable
    to Adiscon GmbH!).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">If you are paying in DM, your check must be drawn on a German bank
    and made payable to &quot;Adiscon GmbH&quot;. Please note that the check <strong>must</strong>
    <strong>be drawn on a German bank</strong>. Even if you reside inside a member state of
    the European Community, you can <strong>not</strong> use &quot;Euro Cheque&quot; (EC) made
    payable in DM.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">We apologize for the restrictions in our check acceptance policy. We
    were forced to introduce these by banking regulations and fees (one quick example: our
    banks charge DEM 20,-- for any EC check payable in DEM - this is quite a good share for a
    DEM 39,95 product!).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">If you need an additional payment options, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Info@Adiscon.com">Info@Adiscon.com</a> or the below given addresses. Please
    note that &#150; for your security &#150; we generally do not accept email registrations.
