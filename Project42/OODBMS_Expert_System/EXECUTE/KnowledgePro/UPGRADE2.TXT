New Features
----------------------
Several new features and enhancements can be found in

described below, expand KnowledgePro's capability in 
handling screen objects, graphics, Dynamic Link Libraries, 
and various events recognized by Windows.

New features and overall optimization increase performance 
and generally enhance KnowledgePro's viability as a  
development tool for building intelligent Windows 
applications.

New Functions

Functions added to KnowledgePro are categorized as 
follows: 

Screen Objects
----------------------
The combo box has been added. The various combo box 
functions are:

combo_box
Creates a Standard Windows 3.x combo box - a 
combined edit line and list box. Options available 
for changing the style of combo box.

get_combo_box
Retrieves the combo box selection.

Sets the list box selection. This feature became 
available in version 1.1 and is now fully 
documented.

set_window_colors
Sets the text color and background colors for an 
existing window.

Graphics
----------------------
Further support for manipulating hyper-regions, bitmaps 
and cursors has been added. Functions for dragging 
objects have also been added.

adjust_drag_rect
Resizes the dragging rectangle.

bitmap_info
Retrieves dimensions of a bitmap. Can be used to 
create windows that "fit" around a bitmap.

capture_hyper_region
Captures the contents of a hyper-region and 
creates a bitmap of the contents. Can be used to 
capture and print screens.

create_char_font
Creates fonts with respect to system characters 
for greater portability. This feature became 
available in version 1.1 and is now fully 
documented.

available in version 1.1 and is now fully 
documented.

Specifies a different cursor for use with 
hypertext and hyper-regions. This feature became 
available in version 1.1 and is now fully 
documented.

invalidate_rect

repainting. Invalid regions are painted when a 
wait state is reached, update_window is called or 
an other action occurs which forces a window to 
paint.

invert_hyper_region
Inverts the colors for a hyper-region. Can be used 
to create special effects for hyper-regions and 
custom buttons.

set of pre-defined cursors.

validate_rect
