</ol>

	<b>COMMUINICATION TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS </b><br>
The Server Component of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version should have a fixed IP defined by the system operator. System can be deployed over any TCP/IP based network, including LAN, WAN, Dial Up, ISDN, Ethernet etc.
<p>
<b>CLIENT PLATFORM AND OPERATING SYSTEM</b>
<p>
Mirabilis provides the Client Component of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version Software. Platforms and Supporting Software are to be provided by Customer: 
<ol>
	<li> <b>Client Platforms:</b> any 486DX machine, 8MB or higher, 3.5 MB of disk space.
	<li> <b>Client Operating System:</b> Windows NT 4.0 or higher, Windows 95.
	<li> <b>Interoperability</b> - different users may use various different operating systems on the same Intranet network.
</ol>
<b>DATABASE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</b>
<ol>
	<li> <b>DataBase Software.</b> The System can access any ODBC 2.0 compliant databases (Oracle, Sybase, Informix, SQL Server etc.). The System comes  with Microsoft ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager subject to the terms and conditions of the ODBC license agreement that accompanies the System.
 	<li> <b>DataBase Platform.</b> Database software can reside at the same computer the ICQ Server resides at, or at any computer that is connected to it through Customer's net.
</ol>

<b>REGISTRATION AND CONTENT</b>
<ol>
	<li> <b>Data structure and Content.</b> After the system operator defined the required ODBC connection (DSN) between the Server Component of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version and the Customer database Component of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version, the ICQ Data Base Wizard creates the necessary tables while the setup process is being made.
	<li> <b>Registration to the System.</b> Each user and his details are registered and submitted individually, either by himself or by the system operator.
</ol>
<b>FIREWALL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</b>
<p>
The System can work from behind many firewalls, depending on the firewall configuration. No changes required in Customer's system configuration if Server and Clients Components of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version are reside at the same side of the firewall. That is to say both following conditions are met:<br>
1) No firewall exists between Clients and Server Components of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version. <br>
2) No firewall exists between any two  Client Components of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version.<br> 
<p>
If condition 1 is not met, firewall should be reconfigured by opening a port, or by making a port mapping. If condition 2 is not met, the desired port should be defined in both Client Component of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version software and in the firewall, or a proxy SOCKS 4 or SOCKS 5 server can be used. 
<p>
If a firewall exists between some two Client Components of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version and the firewall can not be configured according to these requirements, only messages and URLs are available to the user in server relay mode, provided that all Clients are able to communicate with the server. In this mode all the traffic is relayed via the Server Component of the ICQ Groupware, Beta Version. Mirabilis technical department is available for further assistance. 
<p>
The System will have no effect on the performance of the external collaborating voice, video, data, browsing and group chats applications, which user is launching by ICQ, while being connected through a firewall. Those applications will be subject to their own firewall configuration requirements and will perform irrespectively of the System.
