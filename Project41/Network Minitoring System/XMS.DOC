      are using this library, either successfully or unsuccessfully.
      Feel free to suggest enhancements, find bugs or (better still)
      fix them and send me patches.  The more feedback I get the more
      likely I am to update these classes or to continue producing
      freeware programming tools.  Massage my ego, it doesn't cost
      you much!


    1. Introduction.
    ----------------
    The classes in this library provide a convenient object-oriented
    interface to the functions provided by an XMS driver such as
    HIMEM.SYS for programs compiled using Borland C++.  Three base
    classes are provided corresponding to the three memory regions
    that an XMS driver manages: class XMS deals with extended memory
    blocks above the 1M address boundary that are not directly accessible
    from DOS, class UMB deals with upper memory blocks allocated in the
    system area between 640K and 1M, and class HMA deals with the high
    memory area, an area of slightly less than 64K which is immediately
    above the 1M address boundary.  To use these classes, include the
    header file XMS.H in your program and link the compiled result with
    XMS.OBJ (compiled from XMS.CPP).  A template class XMSarray is also
    provided which allows large arrays of a specified type to be created
    which can then be used just like normal arrays.

    The destructors for these classes automatically take care of releasing
    any memory allocated by the class constructors.  However, events which
    cause a program to terminate unexpectedly will mean that the destructors
    are not called, which will result in XMS-managed memory being permanently
    and unrecoverably allocated.  The main culprits are control-break events
    and critical errors (the familiar "abort, retry, fail?" error), so an
    additional class DOSerror (which can also be used independently of this
    library) is provided as a way of intercepting these events.  Certain
    standard C++ library functions such as "abort" and "_exit" should not
    be used (although "exit" can be used providing all local objects have
    been destroyed, since this calls the destructors for global objects),
    and DOS services such as INT 20h or INT 21h function 00 should also
    be avoided.


                                                                      Page 2

    If you really need to, you can deliberately allocate XMS-managed memory
    permanently by creating an object of one of these classes using "new"
    without a corresponding call to "delete".  The memory so allocated will
    remain allocated until the machine is rebooted.


    2. Class XMS.
    -------------
    Declaring an object of class XMS allocates a new XMS block.  There
    is a limit on the number of blocks which can be allocated at any one
    time (imposed by the number of "handles" available to the underlying
    XMS driver), so care should be taken not to allocate too many blocks
    at the same time.

    The constructor takes an optional long integer parameter which
    gives the size of the XMS block to be allocated in bytes.  This
    will be rounded up to at least the nearest K; if it is omitted,
    a block size of zero is assumed.  For example:

        XMS block1;                 // a block of zero bytes
        XMS block2 (1000000);       // a block of one million bytes

    In the second case, the block size will be rounded up to at least
    1000488 bytes (977K).  The actual size can be obtained using the
    member function "size":

        cout << block2.size();      // display actual size of block2

    The block size can be changed at any time with the "resize" member
    function:

        block1.resize (10240);      // resize block1 to 10240 bytes
        block2.resize (10240);      // resize block2 to 10240 bytes

    If the block is not allocated successfully (as a result of there
    being insufficient memory or XMS handles, or because an XMS driver
    is not present), "size" will return a result of zero bytes.  You
    can tell whether a block was allocated successfully using the "valid"
    member function or the "!" operator:

        if (block1.valid()) ...     // block1 was created successfully
        if (!block1) ...            // block1 was not created successfully

    The actual value of the "!" operator is an code of the enumerated
    type "XMS::error" which gives the reason why the block could not be
    allocated.  The possible values of "XMS::error" are listed in the
    header file XMS.H.  The "resize" member function described above
    also returns a result of this type:

        if (block1.resize() != XMS::SUCCESS)
            cerr << "Block 1 resize failed!\n";

    To find out how much XMS memory is actually available, there are two
    static member functions "available" and "largest":

        cout << XMS::available ();  // display available XMS size in bytes
        cout << XMS::largest ();    // display size of largest available
                                    // XMS block in bytes

    Successfully allocated blocks can be copied to or from conventional
    memory (below the 640K boundary), or from one XMS block to another.


                                                                      Page 3

    This is done using the static function "XMS::copy", which requires
    three parameters: a source address, a destination address and the
    number of bytes to be copied.  The source and destination address
    can be either a normal pointer (anything which converts to "void*")
    or an offset into an XMS block.  Offsets into XMS blocks can be
    generated using either the "at" member function or the subscript
    brackets operator "[]":

        block1.at(100)              // 100 bytes past the start of block1
        block1 [100]                // the same thing

    The reason for providing two different ways of expressing the same
    thing is that while "[]" is easier to use with normal objects, "at"
    is easier to use with pointers to objects:

        XMS* xmspointer;            // a pointer to an XMS object
        (*xmspointer)[100]          // offset using "[]"
        xmspointer->at(100)         // offset using "at"

    Thus the following will copy 1000 bytes from an array "x" in conventional
    memory to "block1", from "block1" to "block2", and from "block2" to an
    array "y" in conventional memory:

        XMS::copy (block1 [20], x, 1000);           // x to block1
        XMS::copy (block2 [20], block1 [20], 1000); // block1 to block2
        XMS::copy (y, block2 [20], 1000);           // block2 to y
        
    Each transfer begins 20 bytes from the start of the XMS blocks.  Note
    that the destination is given before the source, just like an assignment
    statement.

    Copy operations should always specify an even number of bytes; if an
    odd block length is specified, it will be rounded down to an even
    number of bytes.  Also, the source and destination addresses should
    not overlap if an XMS-to-XMS copy is made, as overlapping copies are
    not guaranteed to work correctly.  "XMS::copy" returns a result of
    type "XMS::error"; in the case of overlapping copies which fail, the
    result will be the value "XMS::OVERLAP_ERROR".

    Finally, you should be aware that performance may be degraded if
    you copy data to or from an odd address in conventional memory.
    Transferring data to or from a word-aligned address (or doubleword
    aligned if you are using a 386 processor or above) can result in
    much faster data transfer rates.


    3. Class UMB.
    -------------
    Upper memory blocks (UMBs) are located in the system area between
    640K and 1M.  They are therefore directly accessible to DOS programs
    using normal pointers.  You can find out the size of the largest
    available UMB using the static member function "largest":

        cout << UMB::largest(); // display size of the largest available
                                // UMB block in bytes

    The constructor for class UMB takes a long integer specifying the
    size of the block to be allocated in bytes.  This will be rounded
    up to a multiple of at least 16 bytes.  You can find out the actual


                                                                      Page 4

    number of bytes allocated to a UMB using the member function "size".
    For example:

        UMB high (1000);        // allocate a 1000 byte UMB
        cout << high.size();    // display the actual size

    The actual size for this example will be at least 1008 bytes (the
    nearest multiple of 16 above the requested size of 1000 bytes), but
    may be higher depending on the XMS driver you are using.  If the
    UMB could not be allocated, the size will be zero.  You can find
    out if the allocation succeeded using the member function "valid"
    or the "!" operator, which behave identically to the corresponding
    operations in class XMS (as described above):

        if (high.valid()) ...   // UMB was created successfully
        if (!high) ...          // UMB was not created successfully

    The address of the UMB can be obtained using the member function
    "addr".  This can be cast to an appropriate type and assigned to
    a pointer variable, which must be a far pointer (or a huge pointer
    if the UMB is greater than 64K in size).  For example:

        int far* hi = (int far*) high.addr();
                                // use the UMB address as a pointer

    This pointer can then be used to treat the UMB as a normal array:

        hi[n] = 1234;           // assign a value to an integer in the UMB

    It is your own responsibility to ensure that you do not write to memory
    outside the bounds of the allocated block.  If you do not, data in the
    system area will be corrupted, which may cause the system to crash.


    4. Class HMA.
    -------------
    The high memory area (HMA) is a block of 65520 (64K - 16) bytes
    located immediately above the 1M address boundary.  Due to a quirk
    in the implementation of 286 and later processors, this area is
    directly accessible to DOS programs.  The HMA can only be allocated
    once; unlike XMS and UMBs, it is not possible to allocate multiple
    HMA blocks.  The HMA can be allocated by declaring an object of
    class HMA, whose constructor takes an optional unsigned integer
    parameter specifying the size of the allocation required; if it
    is omitted, the whole 65520 bytes will be allocated:

        HMA hma1 (10000);       // allocate 10000 bytes in the HMA
        HMA hma2;               // allocate 65520 bytes in the HMA

    You can find out whether the HMA was allocated successfully using
    the member function "valid" or the "!" operator, which behave in
    exactly the same way as the corresponding operations defined in
    class XMS:

        if (hma1.valid()) ...   // HMA was allocated successfully
        if (!hma1) ...          // HMA was not allocated successfully

    Note that it is impossible for both declarations above to succeed in
    allocating the HMA since it can only be allocated once.  Note also
    that the XMS driver will refuse requests of less than a certain


                                                                      Page 5

    minimum size to maximise HMA usage.  This is normally set by the
    /HMAMIN= driver parameter.  If the HMA is available but HMAMIN is
    set to over 10000, the declaration of "hma1" above will fail but
    the declaration of "hma2" will succeed.

    Due to the peculiar nature of the HMA, the only completely safe
    operation is to copy data to and from conventional memory.  A
    similar scheme to that used in class XMS is provided in class
    HMA for copying data to and fro.  Offsets into the HMA can be
    generated using either the "at" member function or the subscript
    brackets operator "[]":

        hma1.at(100)            // 100 bytes past the start of the HMA
        hma1 [100]              // the same thing

    Thus the following will copy 100 bytes from an array called "x" in
    conventional memory to "hma1" at offset 100, from "hma1" offset 100
    to "hma1" offset 200, and from "hma1" offset 200 to an array "y" in
    conventional memory:

        HMA::copy (hma1 [100], x, 100);             // x to HMA
        HMA::copy (hma1 [200], hma1 [100], 100);    // HMA to HMA
        HMA::copy (y, hma1 [200], 100);             // HMA to y
        
    Note that the destination is given before the source, just like an
    assignment statement.  Note also that the source and destination
    areas should not overlap if an HMA-to-HMA copy is made; overlapping
    copies are not guaranteed to work correctly.

    "HMA::copy" returns the number of bytes actually copied.  If the
    requested number of bytes would go beyond the HMA allocation as
    specified when constructing the HMA object, only as many bytes as
    will fit into the space available will be transferred.  Thus in
    the case of "hma1" (which was declared with a desired HMA size of
    10000 bytes), the call:

        HMA::copy (hma1 [9000], x, 2000);

    will only result in 1000 bytes being copied.  You can find out the
    size of the HMA allocation using the member function "size";

        cout << hma1.size();    // number of bytes of HMA allocated to "hma1"

    The value of "size" will be zero if the HMA was not allocated
    successfully.


    5. Class DOSerror.
    ------------------
    Items stored in XMS are accessed using a "handle" allocated by the
    XMS driver.  The XMS block referenced by this handle must be freed
    by calling the XMS driver to deallocate the handle.  This will be
    done automatically when exiting from the program, but unexpected
    program terminations will exit the program without freeing the
    handle.  This will result in a permanently allocated block of XMS
    and an associated handle which cannot be freed.

    To prevent this happening, you should ensure that programs using
    XMS classes are only ever terminated by returning from "main" or
    by calling the standard library function "exit" (and then only when


                                                                      Page 6

    any local XMS library objects have already been destroyed, as "exit"
    only destroys globally-created objects).  You should avoid calling
    the library functions "_exit" or "abort" or using DOS services such
    as INT 20H to terminate your program.  You should also intercept
    control-break interrupts and critical errors, as these can terminate
    your program unexpectedly at any time (although critical errors are
    only a problem if "abort" is selected at the DOS "abort, retry, fail?"
    prompt when a disk or printer error occurs).

    To guard against control-breaks and critical errors, an additional
    class DOSerror is provided in the library distribution.  This will
    intercept the control-break and critical error interrupts and call
    virtual functions "controlBreak" and "criticalError" whenever either
    of these occur.  The default actions for class DOSerror are to ignore
    control-breaks and to respond to critical errors with a "fail" response.
    If these are adequate for your application, all you need to do is to
    include a declaration like:

        DOSerror d;     // ignore control-breaks, fail critical errors

    and as long as "d" is in scope, control-break events will be ignored
    and critical errors will be failed automatically.

    You can derive new application-specific error-handling classes from
    DOSerror which overload the functions "controlBreak" and "criticalError"
    to provide some appropriate behaviour; for example, if you wanted to
    retry all critical errors and set a flag if control-break is pressed,
    you could define the following class:

        class MyDOSerror : public DOSerror {
          public:
            MyDOSerror () : DOSerror ()         { flag = 0; }
            int broken ()                       { return flag; }
          protected:
            virtual error criticalError (int)   { return DOSerror::RETRY; }
            virtual void  controlBreak  ()      { flag = 1;}
          private:
            int flag;                           // set to 1 by control-break
        };
    
    The critical error handler has an integer parameter which is the DOS
    code specifying the cause of the critical error.  It must return a
    value of DOSerror::RETRY (retry the failed operation), DOSerror::IGNORE
    (ignore the error and continue) or DOSerror::FAIL (fail the operation
    which caused the error).  Any other value will cause the result to be
    reported as DOSerror::FAIL.  Note that critical error handlers should
    only use DOS (INT 21h) services 01h through 0Ch, which means that most
    library I/O functions are unsafe for use in overloaded versions of
    "criticalError".

    To use this class, include the header file DOSERROR.H then link the
    compiled result with DOSERROR.OBJ (generated from DOSERROR.CPP).


    6. Class XMSarray.
    ------------------
    The class XMSarray is a template which allows you to declare large
    arrays of a specified type to be held in extended memory (XMS).
    There are no restrictions on the number of arrays you can create;
    a single XMS handle is used for all arrays created with this class.


                                                                      Page 7

    The penalty for this is that arrays created with XMSarray cannot be
    resized after they have been created.

    To use class XMSarray, include the header file XMSARRAY.H and then
    link the compiled result with XMSARRAY.OBJ and XMS.OBJ (generated
    from XMSARRAY.CPP and XMS.CPP respectively).  Note that this class
    was created and tested using Borland C++ version 3.1; some users of
    earlier releases of this class have reported that it fails to compile
    with version 3.0 of the compiler.  This appears to be a bug in the
    implementation of templates, and no workaround has been suggested
    for this as yet (other than upgrading to version 3.1!).  If you have
    trouble compiling the applications supplied which use the template
    classes defined in XMSARRAY.H, please contact the author at one of
    the addresses listed above with details of the errors and the compiler
    version being used.

    An XMS array is created by a declaration in the following format:

        XMSarray<T> array(n);

    where "T" is the type of elements to be held in the array, "array"
    is the name you have chosen for the array, and "n" is the number of
    elements in the array.  T can be any type which does not have either
    a constructor or a destructor (e.g. a built-in type or a "struct").
    In addition, it must be possible to assign new values to objects of
    type T (i.e. T must not be a const type).  Thus for example:

        XMSarray<long> a(1000000);

    declares an array of 1,000,000 long integers called "a".  You can then
    check that the array has been allocated correctly by calling the member
    function "valid" or the member operator "!":

        if (a.valid()) ...      // "a" was allocated successfully
        if (!a) ...             // "a" was not allocated successfully

    which returns TRUE if the array has been allocated successfully and
    FALSE otherwise (e.g. if there was insufficient free XMS available).
    If the array is not allocated, it can still be used without causing
    any errors to be reported but all operations performed on it will be
    ignored.

    Having declared the array, it can be subscripted in the same way as
    any normal array:

        long v;         // declare a long integer variable "v"
        a[999999] = v;  // assign "v" to the last element of the array
        v = a[999999];  // assign the last element of the array to "v"
        a[0] = a[1];    // copy one array element to another
        f (a[0]);       // pass an array element to a function

    If the subscript is outside the permitted bounds for the array, the
    access will be directed to an extra dummy element that is always
    allocated (i.e. requesting N elements means that N+1 elements are
    always allocated, with the last one being used for all accesses whose
    subscript is out of range).  One major restriction is that you cannot
    assign to individual fields of an array element if the element is a
    structure or a class, and must use a cast to access the value of an
    individual field:


                                                                      Page 8

        struct Pair { int x, y; };  // a pair of integers
        XMSarray<Pair> a(100000);   // an array of pairs
        int i = Pair(a[0]).x;       // this is OK...
        int i = a[0].x;             // ...but this is not (cast needed)
        a[0].x = i;                 // ...and neither is this (a[0].x
                                    //    isn't an lvalue)

    To achieve the equivalent effect to "a[0].x = i" you must copy the
    array element to a variable in conventional memory, modify the field,
    and then copy the modified variable back into the array:

        Pair p = a[0];
        p.x = i;
        a[0] = p;

    Note that XMS arrays, unlike conventional arrays, cannot be treated
    as pointers.  Taking the address of an array element will produce
    the address of the object used to represent the position of the
    array element in XMS memory.

    Accessing XMS is an expensive operation by comparison with accessing
    conventional memory.  The overhead is much greater for arrays whose
    elements are fairly small; the access time per byte is roughly 10
    times greater for an array of 10-byte objects than for an array of
    10000-byte objects.  To alleviate this, an internal cache is used to
    minimise the number of transfers to and from XMS.  The default size
    for this cache is 2K bytes, and this will be rounded up to a power
    of 2 times the size of the items, so that for 10-byte items the
    actual cache size will be 2560 bytes (256 items of 10 bytes each).
    To maximise performance, you can specify the desired cache size when
    you declare an array:

        XMSarray<long> a(1000000, 8000);

    The second parameter to the constructor is the size required for the
    cache in bytes.  In this case 8000 bytes have been requested; since
    long integers are 4 bytes long, the actual cache size will be 8192
    bytes (due to rounding up, the cache will be large enough to hold
    2048 items of 4 bytes each rather than 2000 items of 4 bytes each).


    7. Test programs.
    -----------------
    A number of test programs have been included in the library distribution,
    both as examples of using the library classes and as a means of using
    them and obtaining performance data for them.  The test programs are as
    follows:

      * XMSTEST : test the operation of the XMS class.  This program uses
        a simple menu-driven interface to allow you to create, copy and
        destroy XMS blocks of different sizes and to display XMS usage
        statistics.

      * XMSTIME : time the speed of transfers to and from XMS.  You can use
        this to transfer blocks of different sizes from conventional memory
        to XMS, from XMS to XMS, and from XMS back to conventional memory.
        Timing information is displayed for each transfer.

      * UMBTEST : similar to XMSTEST, but for UMBs.

      * HMATEST : similar to XMSTEST, but for the HMA.

      * XARRTEST : test the operation of the XMSarray class.  This program
        uses a simple menu-driven interface to allow you to create, copy and
        destroy XMS arrays of different sizes and element sizes and display
        XMS usage statistics.

      * XARRTIME : time the speed of transfers to and from XMS arrays.  You
        can use this to transfer array elements of different sizes from
        conventional memory to an XMS array and vice versa, and from XMS
        to XMS.  Timing information is displayed for each transfer.  The
        cache size can be altered to discover the effects of different
        cache sizes on transfer rates; the tests include two copy tests,
        one of which will always be copying a cached array element (the
        same element is copied repeatedly) and the other should never
        use the cache (elements from opposite ends of the array are used).

    Note that there are no timing tests for UMBs and the HMA, since both
    of these are accessed as conventional memory without the protected
    mode driver overheads incurred by XMS accesses.


    8. Omissions.
    -------------
    The XMS standard defines a number of other XMS services which these
    libraries do not include.  There is no support for manipulating or
    querying the state of the A20 address line (which is used when accessing
    the HMA) or for locking and unlocking XMS blocks.  The information about
    XMS handles is restricted to the block size; there are no functions at
    present for reporting the number of free XMS handles or the number of
    times an XMS block has been locked.  These functions may be provided
    in a future release if enough users report a need for them.
