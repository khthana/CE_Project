<font size=5 color=White>Text Replacement (Old method)</font><BR>
<BR>
This old method is slower, but works more often. Try the new method 
first.<BR>
<BR>
Having replaced a font within the rom, most of the text using that 
font will have been 'corrputed'. In other words, it will not make 
sense as either Japanese or English. The following example shows 
how to replace the text with your own messages.

<font size=4 color=Yellow>Step 1: Guess at character values</font><BR>
<TABLE border=0>
<TR><TD><font size=2 color="#ccffcc" face="Verdana, Arial"><B>
This can be one of the hardest parts of the translation. You need 
to work out what number corresponds to what character. Usually,
you can do this by looking at the area of the rom where the character 
tiles are held. If you look back into the rom you should be able to 
find where the tiles seem to start. In this example, the letter 'A' 
was put at 0x056E6C (see 8x8 font section). By looking back into the 
rom, you can see that the pattern of the font data (nn FF nn FF...) 
starts at 0x056D6C (the first tile's data is highlighted).

Now, you know where the font tiles start, you can work out each tile's 
offset in the tile data.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="#ffddcc">
eg. for 'A' which is located at 0x056E6C,<BR> 
the offset is 0x056E6C - 0x056D6C = 0x0100.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Seeing as each tile is 16 bytes long (8 bytes data, mixed with 8 
bytes of 0xFF (2 bitplanes)), you can calculate the 'number' of 
each character in the set.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="#ffddcc">
eg. for 'A' offset=0x0100, tile size=0x010 (=16 bytes)<BR>
tile 'number' is 0x0100 / 0x010 = 0x010<BR>
So, character 'A' is tile 'number' 0x10 = 16

<font size=4 color=Yellow>Step 2: Select a Message to Translate</font><BR>
<TABLE border=0>
<TR><TD>
<img src="dejap06.gif" border=0 align=middle WIDTH=224 HEIGHT=144>
</TD>
<TD><font size=2 color="#ccffcc" face="Verdana, Arial"><B>
Select a message within the text that has a fair number of converted 
(English) characters in it. For example, the text 'EJY....' in the 
menu to the left.
<BR>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
<font size=4 color=Yellow>Step 3: Convert the Message to 'numbers'</font><BR>
<TABLE border=0>
<TR>
<TD><font size=2 color="#ccffcc" face="Verdana, Arial"><B>
Using the numbers found in step one, convert as much of the message as 
you can into a sequence of bytes.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="#ffddcc">
eg. 'EJY...' = 0x14, 0x19, 0x28...<BR>
('E'=0x14, 'J'=0x19, 'Y'=0x28)
</font>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
<font size=4 color=Yellow>Step 4: Find and Translate Message</font><BR>
<TABLE border=0>
<TR><TD>
<img src="dejap08.gif" border=0 align=middle WIDTH=224 HEIGHT=144>
</TD>
<TD><font size=2 color="#ccffcc" face="Verdana, Arial"><B>
Search the rom for the sequence bytes. When you find them, replace 
them with a new sequence that will display a relevant message. 
In this case, the message 'Message speed?' (use the tile 'numbers' found 
in step one to compose the message). If you do not find the bytes, 
you have either got the tile 'numbers' wrong in part one, or the 
text is somehow encrypted or packed into the rom. Until I find a 
program to search for 'relative' strings, you will have to try again!
