referred to as 16x16 tiles, but are really 10x12 tiles) are
commonly used in SNES games. Such examples are the SNES Final
Fantasies (FF4, FF5, and FF6), the SNES Dragon Quest/Dragon
Warrior Series (DQ 3 remake, DQ 1 &amp; 2 remake, DQ5, and DQ 6)
and others. In reality, 10x12 tiles are not composed together in
one tile, as many people believe. Instead, they are actually
composed as 3 tiles, but are represented by only one address in
the SNES. This makes it possible for the large characters seen in
some games. These tiles are usually found in 1 bitplane mode.<br>

(found at: http://www.public.iastate.edu/~jfries/DQ.htm). These
sprite editors are capable of viewing tiles in 1 bitplane mode.
This is useful, as the tiles are usually found in 1 bitplane
mode.<br>

</font><font size="2" face="Arial">Okay, here comes the hard
part. How in the blazes do you edit them things?? Well, simple.
Here's how the 16x16 tile format works.</font><br>

<div align="center"><center>

<table border="3" cellspacing="1">
    <tr>
        <td><img

<p align="left"><br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">As you can see, the tile is split
into 2 12x8 halves. You can do double letters easily by using one
letter as the first half, and the second letter as the second
half! This makes double letters easily without having to scrunch
'em up in one tile. To edit them, draw one (or two, if you're
trying the &quot;double letter method&quot;) 12x8 tile on paper
(so you know what you're doing) and replace the japanese tile
with the english one. If you are making only one letter for that
tile, MAKE SURE the second half is completely blank (or else
you'll still have japanese remnants in your tile!!) Some japanese
chars have part of the tile as the first half, and part as the
second half. You can do this too as a method as making wide
tiles.<br>
<br>
Finding characters of these large tiles are easy. Remember that
the entire thing (all 3 parts) count in a hexeditor as ONE TILE,
so it's much easier than you think. From where the tile block
ends (and the gabbledegook begins), count backward from FF (in
hex) to where the 10x12's begin. For example, let's say
&quot;z&quot; begins at FE (since FF is space), and after that is
all ROM code (junk). You would make like this:<br>
<br>
FF = space<br>
FE = z<br>
FD = y<br>
FC = x<br>
FB = w <br>
<br>
and so on in that manner. But remember, you have to start at the
LAST tile in that bunch (other sprites count, too). Also, FF
usually is a space, so you will have to count spaces, too. Let's
take an example. The power bar takes up addresses F6 to FE, and
&quot;z&quot; was at F5. You would come up with something like
this:<br>
