What's new in CDX 1.5:

Compiled under DirectX 5.

CDXLink class.  DirectPlay wrapper for multiplayer games.

CDXResource class.  Store all your game files in one large file.

CDXAvi class.  Play AVIs straight onto a CDXSurface, with sound
and windowed/fullscreen support.

CDXMusicCd class.  Play music tracks from CDs.

Features added to CDXSurface class: Fill, DrawClipped changed.

Features added to CDXInput class: COM Joystick, SetActiveDevices,
Control panels, Absolute modes, Joystick range.

CDXSprite::MoveTo and CDXSprite::SetVelocity removed, use SetPos
and SetVel instead.

Tile bitmaps now correctly restore when lost.

Front and back buffers are now CDXSurface pointers.  This will
affect anyone who is accessing these members directly.

Safe to delete all classes on shut down without access violations
(hopefully!).  This also means you can delete your screen object
mid-game to perform mode switching.

LPDIRECTDRAW2 used in CDXScreen.  This allows support for those
good old standard VGA modes (Mode 13h), these perform much faster
than the ModeX ones.
