<u>abstract</u></P>
<li><P>To describe and study a working system, working steps, a resource distribution or a deadlock incident, the modeling is a good way to help us to understand them easily and clearly. Therefore, the greate number of models are designed, for example, State Machine and Finite Automation, etc.
<li>Petri Nets is one of the graphic model which is designed and developed to describe and study several working process information. 
<li>The objectives of this project is to build up a sufficient tool or a sufficient application for studying Petri Nets model. The tool or application is not only designed to do modeling to clearly reflect all working processes step by step but and also to analyse the output of the working processes, therefore, it makes us to understand and analyse the working system easily, clearly, accurately and so forth. With all advantages mentioned above, the project is very interesting and it is worth to be researched. <BR>
